彌勒菩薩所問本願經
Bodhisattva Maitreya’s Original Vow Sutra

西晉月氏國三藏竺法護譯
Translated during the Western Jin dynasty by Dharmarakṣa from the Yuezhi State.

聞如是：
Thus have I heard:

一時佛遊於披祇國，妙華山中恐懼樹間鹿所聚處，與大比丘眾俱，比丘五百人，一切賢聖神通已達，悉尊比丘，其名曰：賢者了本際、賢者馬師、賢者惒波、賢者大稱、賢者賢善、賢者離垢、賢者具足、賢者牛呞、賢者鹿吉祥、賢者優為迦葉、賢者那翼迦葉、賢者迦翼迦葉、賢者大迦葉、賢者所說、賢者所著、賢者面王、賢者難提、賢者和難、賢者羅云、賢者阿難，如是之輩，五百比丘。復有菩薩如彌勒等五百人，其名曰：增意菩薩、堅意菩薩、辯積菩薩、光世音菩薩、大勢至菩薩、瑛吉祥菩薩、軟吉祥菩薩、神通華菩薩、空無菩薩、憙信淨菩薩、根土菩薩、稱土菩薩、柔軟音響菩薩、淨土菩薩、山積菩薩、具足菩薩、根吉祥菩薩，如是等菩薩五百人。
At one time, the Buddha was traveling in the country of Prakrit, in the midst of the beautiful Hua Mountain, among the trees where deer gathered in fear. He was accompanied by a great assembly of five hundred bhikshus, all of whom were venerable monks with complete spiritual powers and wisdom. Their names were: Sage Labonji, Sage Mashi, Sage Hebo, Sage Dacheng, Sage Xianshan, Sage Ligu, Sage Juzu, Sage Niushi, Sage Luji, Sage Youweijia, Sage Nayijia, Sage Jiayijia, Sage Dakaya, Sage Shuoshuo, Sage Suozhuo, Sage Mianwang, Sage Nanti, Sage Henan, Sage Luoyun, and Sage Anan. These were the five hundred bhikshus. There were also five hundred bodhisattvas like Maitreya, whose names were: Bodhisattva Zengyi, Bodhisattva Jianyi, Bodhisattva Bianji, Bodhisattva Guanshiyin, Bodhisattva Dashizhi, Bodhisattva Yingjixiang, Bodhisattva Ruanjixiang, Bodhisattva Shentonghua, Bodhisattva Kongwu, Bodhisattva Xixinjing, Bodhisattva Gentu, Bodhisattva Chentu, Bodhisattva Ruanyinxian, Bodhisattva Jingtu, Bodhisattva Shanju, Bodhisattva Juzu, and Bodhisattva Genjixiang. These were the five hundred bodhisattvas.

爾時彌勒菩薩從座起，整衣服長跪叉手白佛言：「願欲有所問，唯天中天聽者乃敢問。」
At that time, Bodhisattva Maitreya rose from his seat, arranged his robes, knelt with hands joined, and said to the Buddha, "I wish to ask a question, but only if the one who is the highest in heaven listens will I dare to ask."

佛告彌勒菩薩：「我當聽所問，便問在所欲，如來當隨其所欲，而發遣之令心歡喜。」
The Buddha told Bodhisattva Maitreya, "I shall listen to your question. Feel free to ask whatever you wish, and the Tathagata will respond as you desire, bringing joy to your heart."

於是彌勒菩薩得聽所問，踊躍歡喜，白世尊言：「菩薩有幾法行，皆棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中？」
Then, Bodhisattva Maitreya, being allowed to ask, was filled with joy and said to the World-Honored One, "How many practices do bodhisattvas have that enable them to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences?"

佛告彌勒菩薩：「善哉！善哉！彌勒！菩薩多所哀念，多所安隱，愍傷諸天及人，乃發意問如來如此之義。諦聽！常思念之！」
The Buddha told Bodhisattva Maitreya, "Well done! Well done! Maitreya! The bodhisattvas have great compassion and bring much peace, lamenting for the heavens and people alike. Therefore, you have the intention to ask the Tathagata such a question. Listen carefully! Always contemplate this!"

彌勒即言：「唯然世尊，受教而聽。」
Maitreya then said, "Indeed, World-Honored One, I will listen and accept your teaching."

佛言：「彌勒！菩薩有一法行，棄諸惡道，不隨惡知識中。何謂為一？謂寂靜平等道意。是為一法。」
The Buddha said, "Maitreya! There is one practice that bodhisattvas follow to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What is the one practice? It is the intention of a tranquil and equal path. This is the one practice."

佛語彌勒菩薩：「復有二法行，棄諸惡道，不隨惡知識中。何等為二？一者、住於定無所起；二者、方便別諸所見。是為二法。」
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Maitreya: "There are two more practices that enable bodhisattvas to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these two? First, dwelling in concentration without arising thoughts; second, skillfully distinguishing various views. These are the two practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有三法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為三？一者、得大哀法；二者、於空無所習；三者、所知無所念。是為三法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya: "Bodhisattvas have three more practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these three? First, obtaining the great compassion practice; second, not being habituated to emptiness; third, not dwelling on what is known. These are the three practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有四法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為四？一者、立於誡；二者、於一切法無所疑；三者、樂處閑居；四者、等觀。是為四法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya: "Bodhisattvas have four more practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these four? First, establishing in precepts; second, having no doubts in all teachings; third, delighting in solitude; fourth, equal observation. These are the four practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有五法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為五？一者、常立德義；二者、不求他人長短；三者、自省身行；四者、常樂於法；五者、不自念身常救他人。是為五法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya, "Bodhisattvas have five additional practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these five? First, always uphold virtue and righteousness; second, do not seek others' faults and merits; third, reflect on one's own conduct; fourth, always delight in the Dharma; fifth, do not think of oneself but constantly help others. These are the five practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有六法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為六？一者、不慳貪；二者、除弊惡之心；三者、無愚癡；四者、無麁言；五者、其意如虛空；六者、以空為舍。是為六法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya, "Bodhisattvas have six more practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these six? First, not being stingy; second, removing the mind of malice; third, being free from foolishness; fourth, not using harsh words; fifth, having a mind like empty space; sixth, dwelling in emptiness. These are the six practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有七法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為七？一者、有善權之意；二者、能分別於諸法寶；三者、常精進；四者、常當歡悅；五者、得於信忍；六者、善解定意；七者、總智慧明。是為七法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya, "Bodhisattvas have seven additional practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these seven? First, having the intention of skillful means; second, being able to discern the Dharma treasures; third, always being diligent; fourth, always being joyful; fifth, attaining faith and patience; sixth, skillfully understanding concentration; seventh, having comprehensive wisdom. These are the seven practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有八法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為八？一者、得直見；二者、直念；三者、直語；四者、直治；五者、直業；六者、直方便；七者、直意；八者、直定。是為八法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya: "Bodhisattvas have eight additional practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these eight? First, obtaining direct vision; second, direct mindfulness; third, direct speech; fourth, direct governance; fifth, direct profession; sixth, direct skillful means; seventh, direct intention; eighth, direct concentration. These are the eight practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有九法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為九？一者、菩薩以脫於欲，遠離諸惡，不善之法無有想念，以得寂定歡喜，行第一一心；二者、已除想念，內意為寂，其心為一，無想無行便得定意，心為歡悅，行第二一心；三者、離歡喜觀常為寂定，身得安隱如諸聖賢，所說所觀心意無起，行第三一心；四者、苦樂已斷，歡悅憂慼皆悉為止，所觀無苦無樂其意清淨，得第四一心；五者、過於色想；六者、無復說想；七者、不復念種種想，悉入無央數虛空慧；八者、皆過無央數虛空慧，入無量諸識識知之行；九者、皆過諸識知之慧，無復有無之想，皆過諸無識之慧，便入有想無想之行，不見想得寂定三昧。是為九法。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya: "Bodhisattvas have nine additional practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these nine? First, they liberate from desires, distancing from all evil and unwholesome thoughts, gaining joy in tranquility and concentration, practicing the first single-mindedness; second, having eliminated all thoughts, their mind is tranquil and unified, achieving concentration and joy, practicing the second single-mindedness; third, by leaving joy and contemplation, they dwell in constant tranquility, achieving peace like the sages, with unarisen thoughts, practicing the third single-mindedness; fourth, having cut off pleasure and pain, all joy and sorrow cease, perceiving neither suffering nor pleasure, they attain purity, practicing the fourth single-mindedness; fifth, surpassing perception of form; sixth, no longer speaking of perception; seventh, no longer thinking of various perceptions, they enter immeasurable space-like wisdom; eighth, surpassing immeasurable space-like wisdom, they enter boundless awareness, with knowing and understanding; ninth, surpassing all knowledge and understanding, without notions of existence or non-existence, surpassing all wisdom of non-awareness, they enter the practice of both perception and non-perception, unseen, they attain the tranquility of samadhi. These are the nine practices."

佛語彌勒：「菩薩復有十法行，棄諸惡道不隨惡知識中。何等為十？一者、得金剛三昧；二者、所住處有所進益三昧；三者、得善權教授三昧；四者、得有念無念御度三昧；五者、得普遍世間三昧；六者、得於苦樂平等三昧；七者、得寶月三昧；八者、得月明三昧；九者、得照明三昧；十者、得二寂三昧，於一切諸法具足。彌勒！是為菩薩十法行，棄諸惡道不墮惡知識中。」
The Buddha said to Maitreya: "Bodhisattvas have ten additional practices to abandon all evil paths and not follow bad influences. What are these ten? First, obtaining the Vajra Samadhi; second, achieving progress in their abode Samadhi; third, obtaining the skillful means teaching Samadhi; fourth, having mindfulness and no-mindfulness control Samadhi; fifth, obtaining the universal world Samadhi; sixth, achieving equality in suffering and pleasure Samadhi; seventh, obtaining the Jewel Moon Samadhi; eighth, obtaining the Bright Moon Samadhi; ninth, obtaining the Illuminating Samadhi; tenth, obtaining the Dual Tranquility Samadhi, being complete in all Dharmas. Maitreya! These are the ten practices of Bodhisattvas, abandoning all evil paths and not falling into bad influences."

於是彌勒菩薩以偈讚佛言：
Then, Maitreya Bodhisattva praised the Buddha with a verse:

「世尊本布施，　　妻子及飲食，
頭目無所惜，　　佛德度無極。
護禁無所犯，　　如鶡愛其毛，
奉戒無與等，　　功德度無極。
已現於忍力，　　悉等諸苦樂，
忍辱為大勢，　　佛德度無極。
已了精進力，　　無上德對害，
精進為大至，　　佛勤度無極。
已斷一切惡，　　導師樂一心，
大慧寂為力，　　佛淨度無極。
清淨慧自在，　　自然無所起，
智慧常第一，　　佛明度無極。
慧降魔官屬，　　樹下得大智，
上義離諸穢，　　佛力降伏魔。
世尊轉法輪，　　大身師子吼，
恐伏諸外道，　　佛慧度彼德。
色妙無與等，　　戒德及智慧，
精進度諸岸，　　佛道過眾德，
難譬不可喻，　　無上大智慧，
常講諸法寶，　　光明導御眾。」

"The World-Honored One originally practiced generosity, giving away wife, children, and food. Sparing not even head or eyes, Buddha's virtues are boundless.

Protecting precepts without fault, like the kalaviṅka cherishing its feathers. Keeping precepts unparalleled, merits are boundless.

Already displaying the power of patience, treating all suffering and joy equally. Patience is the great strength, Buddha's virtues are boundless.

Having mastered the power of diligence, supreme virtue confronts harm. Diligence reaches the greatest, Buddha's effort is boundless.

Having cut off all evils, the teacher delights in single-mindedness. Great wisdom and tranquility are the strength, Buddha's purity is boundless.

Pure wisdom is free, naturally arising without cause. Wisdom is always foremost, Buddha's light is boundless.

Wisdom subdues the demon's retinue, gaining great wisdom under the tree. Sublime meaning removes all impurities, Buddha's power subdues the demon.

The World-Honored One turns the Dharma wheel, the great body roars like a lion. Subduing all external paths, Buddha's wisdom surpasses their virtues.

The splendid form is unparalleled, precepts, virtue, and wisdom. Diligence surpasses all shores, Buddha's path surpasses all virtues.

Difficult to compare, beyond analogy, supreme great wisdom. Always expounding the Dharma treasures, the light guides and leads all."

爾時賢者阿難白佛言：「未曾有世尊！是彌勒菩薩所願具足，說法無缺減，講法字句平等，所說法句無所縛著，講經竟無亂。」
Then, the Venerable Ananda said to the Buddha, "Unprecedented, World-Honored One! Maitreya Bodhisattva's aspirations are fully realized, his teachings are flawless, his words and phrases are balanced, and his spoken Dharma is unbound, without disorder."

佛言：「如是，如是！阿難！如其所云，彌勒菩薩辯才具足，所說經法無所缺減。」
The Buddha said, "Indeed, indeed, Ananda! As you have stated, Maitreya Bodhisattva is fully eloquent, and his teachings are complete without any omission."

佛言：「阿難！彌勒菩薩不獨以偈讚我，乃往過世十無央數劫，爾時有佛號炎光具嚮作王如來、無所著、等正覺、今現在成慧行、安定、世間父、無上士、導御法、天上天下尊、佛、天中天，爾時有梵志長者子名曰賢行，從園觀出，遙見如來經行，身色光明無央數變。見已心念：『甚善！未曾有也！如來之身不可思議，巍巍如是，光色妙好威神照曜，吉祥之德以為莊飾，願令我後當來之世，得身具足如是光色威神照曜，吉祥之德而自莊飾。』作是願已，便身伏地心念言審：『我當來之世得法身，若如來、無所著、等正覺者，如來當過我身上。』於時世尊炎光具嚮作王如來，知賢行長者子梵志心之所念，便過其身上。適越其上已，便得不起法忍。於是佛還顧告侍者言：『我所以過長者子梵志賢行身上，即時令得不起法忍，眼能洞視，耳能徹聽，知他人心中所念，自知所從來生，身能飛行神通具足。』佛適過梵志賢行身上，便達眾智五通具足無所亡失，即以偈讚佛言：
The Buddha said, "Ananda! Maitreya Bodhisattva not only praised me with verses, but also in countless past eons, there was a Buddha named Yan Guang Ju Xiang Zuo Wang Tathagata, who was detached, fully enlightened, currently practicing wisdom, stable, the father of the world, supreme man, guide of the Dharma, revered in heaven and earth, Buddha, and the supreme among gods. At that time, there was a Brahmin elder's son named Xian Xing, who, upon leaving a garden, saw the Tathagata walking, his body radiating countless changes of light. Seeing this, he thought, 'How wonderful! Never before have I seen such an inconceivable body of the Tathagata, so majestic, with splendid light and virtuous majesty as adornments. May I, in future worlds, attain a body with such light, majesty, and auspicious virtues as decoration.' Having made this vow, he prostrated himself on the ground and thought, 'If I, in future worlds, attain a Dharma body like the Tathagata, detached and fully enlightened, may the Tathagata walk over me.' At that time, the World-Honored One Yan Guang Ju Xiang Zuo Wang Tathagata, knowing the thoughts of the Brahmin elder's son Xian Xing, walked over him. As he passed over him, Xian Xing attained the patience of non-arising Dharma. The Buddha then turned to the attendant and said, 'The reason I walked over the Brahmin elder's son Xian Xing was to immediately grant him the patience of non-arising Dharma, enabling him to see clearly, hear thoroughly, know others' thoughts, understand his past lives, and attain complete supernatural powers.' After the Buddha passed over Xian Xing, he gained full knowledge of the five supernatural faculties without any loss, and he praised the Buddha with verses:

「『往來世到十方，　　人中尊無與等，
唯志道過諸行，　　願稽首覺導師。
以過諸世間明，　　及摩尼火炎光，
佛光明為最上，　　願稽首覺導師。
如師子一鳴吼，　　諸小獸無不伏，
佛講法亦如是，　　悉降伏諸異道。
眉間相清且徹，　　威無量如積雪，
其光明照三界，　　佛在世無與等。
聖足下生相輪，　　其輪妙有千輻，
此土地及山陵，　　不能動無上尊。』」

"In future worlds across the ten directions, there is no equal to the honored one among humans.
With determination, surpass all practices, I vow to bow to the enlightened guide.
Surpassing all worldly lights, like the jewel flame,
Buddha's light is supreme, I vow to bow to the enlightened guide.
Like a lion's mighty roar, all small beasts submit,
The Buddha's teaching is likewise, subduing all heretical paths.
The mark between the brows is clear and pure, its majesty as vast as accumulated snow,
Its light illuminates the three realms, the Buddha has no equal in the world.
Under the sacred feet arise the wheel marks, the wheel is wondrous with a thousand spokes,
This land and mountains cannot move the supreme honor."

是時佛告賢者阿難：「欲知爾時長者子梵志賢行者，今彌勒菩薩是。」
At that time, the Buddha told Venerable Ananda, "If you wish to know who the Brahmin elder's son Xian Xing was, it is now Maitreya Bodhisattva."

賢者阿難即白佛言：「彌勒菩薩得不起忍，久遠乃爾，何以不速逮無上正真道最正覺耶？」
Then, the Venerable Ananda addressed the Buddha, "Maitreya Bodhisattva has attained the patience of non-arising for such a long time, why has he not yet quickly achieved the supreme, true, and perfect enlightenment?"

佛語阿難：「菩薩以四事不取正覺。何等為四？一者、淨國土；二者、護國土；三者、淨一切；四者、護一切。是為四事。彌勒菩薩求佛時，以是四事故不取佛。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "A Bodhisattva refrains from attaining perfect enlightenment due to four reasons. What are these four? First, purifying the land; second, protecting the land; third, purifying all beings; fourth, protecting all beings. These are the four reasons. When Maitreya Bodhisattva sought Buddhahood, due to these four reasons, he did not pursue Buddhahood."

佛言：「阿難！我本求佛時，亦欲淨國土亦欲淨一切，亦欲護國土，亦欲護一切。彌勒發意先我之前四十二劫，我於其後乃發道意，於此賢劫以大精進，超越九劫得無上正真之道成最正覺。」
The Buddha said, "Ananda! When I initially sought Buddhahood, I also wished to purify the lands and all beings, and to protect the lands and all beings. Maitreya made this resolve forty-two eons before me. Afterward, during this auspicious eon, with great diligence, I surpassed nine eons to attain the supreme true path and achieve perfect enlightenment."

佛告賢者阿難：「我以十事致最正覺。何等為十？一者、所有無所愛惜；二者、妻婦；三者、兒子；四者、頭目；五者、手足；六者、國土；七者、珍寶財物；八者、髓腦；九者、血肉；十者、不惜身命。阿難！我以此十事疾得佛道。」
The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "I achieved supreme enlightenment through ten practices. What are these ten? First, possess nothing with attachment; second, wives; third, children; fourth, head and eyes; fifth, hands and feet; sixth, land; seventh, treasures and wealth; eighth, marrow and brain; ninth, blood and flesh; tenth, not sparing one's life. Ananda! Through these ten practices, I swiftly attained Buddhahood."

佛語阿難：「復有十事疾得佛道。何等為十？一者、以法立於誡德；二者、常行忍辱；三者、常行精進；四者、常一其心；五者、常行智慧度於無極；六者、不捨一切；七者、已得忍心等於一切；八者、不習空；九者、得空法忍；十者、得無想之法。阿難！我以此十事，自致得佛道。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "There are another ten practices to quickly attain Buddhahood. What are these ten? First, establish virtue through the Dharma; second, practice patience constantly; third, practice diligence constantly; fourth, maintain a unified mind constantly; fifth, practice wisdom to the ultimate limit; sixth, give up nothing; seventh, have attained a mind of patience equal to all; eighth, do not practice emptiness; ninth, attain the patience of the Dharma of emptiness; tenth, attain the Dharma of non-conceptualization. Ananda! Through these ten practices, I achieved Buddhahood myself."

佛語賢者阿難：「我本求佛道時勤苦無數，乃得無上正真之道，其事非一。」
The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "When I originally sought the path of Buddhahood, I endured countless hardships to attain the supreme true path. It was not a singular effort."

佛言阿難：「乃過世時，有王太子，號曰一切現義，端政姝好，從園觀而出，道見一人得疾困篤，見已有哀傷之心，問於病人：『以何等藥得療即痊？』病人答曰：『唯王身血得療我病。』爾時太子即以利刀刺身出血，以與病者，至心施與意無悔恨。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "In a past life, there was a prince named Xian Yi, handsome and noble. While leaving the garden, he saw a man severely ill and was filled with compassion. He asked the sick man, 'What medicine could heal you?' The man replied, 'Only the king's blood can cure me.' The prince then used a sharp knife to cut himself and offered his blood to the sick man, giving it wholeheartedly without regret."

佛語阿難：「爾時現義太子，即我身是。阿難！四大海水尚可升量，我身血施不可稱限。所以爾者，求正覺故。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "At that time, the prince Xian Yi was indeed my own self. Ananda! The waters of the four great seas can be measured, but the offering of my blood cannot be quantified. This is because it was for the sake of seeking true enlightenment."

佛語賢者阿難：「乃往過世有王太子，號曰蓮花王，端正姝好威神巍巍，從園觀出遊，道見一人身體病癩，見已即有哀念心，問於病人：『以何等藥療於汝病？』病者答曰：『得王身髓以塗我體，其病乃愈。』是時太子即破身骨，以得其髓持與病者，歡喜惠施，心無悔恨。爾時太子，即我身是。」
"The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, 'In a past life, there was a prince named Lotus King, handsome and noble, with great power and majesty. While traveling from the garden, he saw a man afflicted with leprosy and felt compassion for him. He asked the sick man, "What medicine can cure your illness?" The man replied, "Only the prince's marrow applied to my body will heal me." At that time, the prince broke his own bones to obtain the marrow and gave it to the sick man, offering it joyfully and without regret. That prince was indeed my own self.'"

佛語阿難：「四大海水尚可升量，身髓布施不可稱計。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "The waters of the four great seas can be measured, but the giving of one's marrow cannot be quantified."

佛語賢者阿難：「乃往去世有王號曰月明，端正姝好威神巍巍，從宮而出，道見盲者貧窮飢餓隨道乞匃，往趣王所而白王言：『王獨尊貴安隱快樂，我獨貧窮加復眼盲。』爾時月明王見此盲人哀之淚出，謂於盲者：『有何等藥得愈卿病？』盲者答曰：『唯得王眼能愈我病，眼乃得視。』爾時王月明自取兩眼施與盲者，其心靜然無一悔意。月明王者，即我身是。」
The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "In a past life, there was a king named Yue Ming, handsome and noble, with great power and majesty. As he left the palace, he saw a blind, impoverished, and starving man begging along the road. The man approached the king and said, 'You, O King, are noble, secure, and happy, while I am poor and blind.' Moved to tears, King Yue Ming asked the blind man, 'What medicine can cure your illness?' The blind man replied, 'Only the king's eyes can cure my blindness, and restore my sight.' At that time, King Yue Ming willingly plucked out his own eyes and gave them to the blind man, remaining calm and without any regret. That King Yue Ming was indeed my own self."

佛言：「須彌山尚可稱知斤兩，我眼布施不可稱計。」
The Buddha said, "Mount Sumeru's weight can be measured, but the offering of my eyes is immeasurable."

佛語賢者阿難：「彌勒菩薩本求道時，不持耳、鼻、頭、目、手、足、身命、珍寶、城邑、妻子及以國土布施與人，以成佛道，但以善權方便安樂之行，得致無上正真之道。」
The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "When Bodhisattva Maitreya originally sought the path, he did not offer his ears, nose, head, eyes, hands, feet, life, treasures, cities, wives, children, or land to others to attain Buddhahood. Instead, he achieved the supreme true path through skillful means and practices of ease and happiness."

阿難白佛：「彌勒菩薩以何善權得致佛道？」
Ananda asked the Buddha, "Through what skillful means did Bodhisattva Maitreya attain Buddhahood?"

佛言阿難：「彌勒菩薩晝夜各三正衣束體，叉手下膝著地，向於十方說此偈言：
The Buddha said to Ananda, "Bodhisattva Maitreya, day and night, dressed in the three proper garments, knelt with hands clasped and recited this verse facing the ten directions:

「『我悔一切過，　　勸助眾道德，
歸命禮諸佛，　　令得無上慧。』」
"I repent all my transgressions and encourage the cultivation of all virtues,
I pay homage to all Buddhas, to attain supreme wisdom."

佛語賢者阿難：「彌勒菩薩以是善權，得無上正真之道最正覺。阿難！彌勒菩薩求道本願：『使其作佛時，令我國中人民，無有諸垢瑕穢，於婬怒癡不大，慇懃奉行十善，我爾乃取無上正覺。』」
The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "Bodhisattva Maitreya, through skillful means, attained the supreme true path and ultimate enlightenment. Ananda! Bodhisattva Maitreya's original vow was: 'When I achieve Buddhahood, let the people in my country be free from impurities and defilements, not be overcome by lust, anger, or ignorance, and diligently practice the ten virtues. Only then will I obtain supreme enlightenment.'"

佛語阿難：「後當來世人民，無有垢穢奉行十善，於婬怒癡不以經心。正於爾時，彌勒當得無上正真之道成最正覺。所以者何？彌勒菩薩本願所致。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "In future generations, people will be free from impurities and diligently practice the ten virtues, with no heed given to lust, anger, or ignorance. At that time, Maitreya will attain the supreme true path and ultimate enlightenment. Why is this so? It is due to Bodhisattva Maitreya's original vow."

佛語賢者阿難：「我本求菩薩道時，欲護一切悉令得淨，處於五濁婬怒癡中，樂在生死。所以者何？是諸人民多為非法，以非為是，奉行邪道轉相賊害，不孝父母心常念惡，惡意向兄弟妻息眷屬及他人，輕易師和上，常犯男子垢濁轉相食噉，願處是時世於中為佛。若郡國丘聚縣邑，但說眾惡轉相賊害，瓦石相擊杖相撾撥，便共聚會轉相罵詈，自還其舍設置飯食，以毒著中欲害他人，起想垢濁轉起誹謗，伏匿過惡還相發露無復善意。」
The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "When I originally sought the Bodhisattva path, I wished to protect all beings and cleanse them, dwelling amidst the five defilements of lust, anger, and ignorance, yet finding joy in samsara. Why so? Because many people commit unlawful acts, mistaking wrong for right, practicing evil ways, causing harm to each other, being unfilial to their parents, constantly harboring evil thoughts towards siblings, wives, children, and others, disrespecting teachers, often engaging in defilement and cannibalism, I desired to be a Buddha in such a time and world. In regions, cities, and towns, only evil deeds and mutual harm are spoken of, stones clash, sticks strike, then they gather to insult each other, return home to prepare meals, poisoning them to harm others, conceiving of defilement and slander, concealing evil deeds, and revealing them without any good intent."

佛言阿難：「我以大哀普念一切，為此輩人講說經法。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "With great compassion, I contemplate all beings and expound the Dharma for these people."

賢者阿難聞佛說此，即白佛言：「未曾有是！天中天、如來、等正覺能至勤苦普弘大意，調御弊惡令得成就，為除重擔具足法寶，為此輩人說其經法。」
Venerable Ananda, upon hearing this from the Buddha, said, "Unprecedented! The Deva of Devas, the Tathagata, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is able to endure great hardship and widely promote profound meaning, guiding beings to overcome their faults and achieve success, removing burdens while possessing the treasures of the Dharma, and expounding the teachings for these people."

佛言：「如是，阿難！如汝所言，佛能忍此。爾乃應、如來、等正覺教化剛強為除眾冥，用佛法德具足之故，乃為此人說其經法。」
The Buddha said, "Indeed, Ananda! As you have stated, the Buddha can endure this. Thus, the Tathagata, the Perfectly Enlightened One, teaches the stubborn to remove their ignorance, employing the complete virtues of the Dharma, and expounds the teachings for these people."

阿難白佛言：「我聞如來堅重精進等心如是，衣毛為竪。此經名為何等？云何奉行？」
Ananda said to the Buddha, "I have heard of the Tathagata's firm and diligent mind, causing my hair to stand on end. What is the name of this sutra? How should one practice it?"

佛言阿難：「此經名為『本願』，當持；『慈氏本行彌勒所問』，當善持之。」
The Buddha said to Ananda, "This sutra is called 'The Original Vow,' and you should uphold it; it is also called 'Questions on Maitreya's Original Practices,' and you should practice it diligently."

佛說經已，彌勒菩薩、賢者阿難、賢者大迦葉諸大弟子，及眾菩薩，一切會者，諸天、龍神、乾沓惒、世間人，聞經歡喜，前為佛作禮。
After the Buddha had spoken the sutra, Bodhisattva Maitreya, Venerable Ananda, Venerable Mahakasyapa, the great disciples, along with all the bodhisattvas, all those present, devas, dragon deities, gandharvas, and the people of the world, heard the teaching with joy and paid homage to the Buddha.
