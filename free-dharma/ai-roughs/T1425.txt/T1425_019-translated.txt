【佛法僧伽弟子】三皈依

[Disciple of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha] The Three Refuges

一時佛在舍衛城祇樹給孤獨園

At one time, the Buddha was in the Jetavana Anathapindika Park in Shravasti.

與大比丘眾千二百五十人倶

Accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks.

是時舍利弗在王舍城

At that time, Shariputra was in Rajagaha.

告比丘曰

He said to the monks,

今日當作法侶 

"Today, you should establish companionship in practice."

汝等應時往集魚池 

"You all should go in time to gather by the fish pond."

作如是言

Speaking thus,

我等皆共出家學道者 

"We are all renunciates learning the path together."

今者我等可各各共作法侶

"Now, let's each pair up as companions in practice."

是時比丘不知法侶

At that time, the monks did not know what companionship in practice was.

共共者故亦不成法侶

And due to their mutual ignorance, companionship in practice was not established.

我者故亦不成法侶

Due to selfishness, companionship in practice was also not established.

摩訶僧祇律卷第十九東晉天竺三藏佛陀跋陀羅共法顯譯  
The Nineteenth Volume of the Mahasanghika Vinaya, Translated Jointly by Buddha Bhadra and Faxian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty from India  




明單提九十二事法之八  

The clarity on raising ninety-two matters in the law of the eight  




，廣說如上。  
The Buddha stayed in the city of Śrāvastī, teaching broadly as above.

爾時優波難陀語兄難陀共行弟子作如是言：「阿浮婆共汝入聚落，彼間當與汝飲食。  
At that time, Upananda said to his fellow disciple Nanda, "Let's go into the village together, where they will offer you food.

我若彼作非威儀事，汝當覆藏，莫向人說。我是汝叔父，我亦覆汝和上罪。」  
If I act improperly there, you should cover for me and not tell anyone. I am your uncle, and I will cover for your teacher's faults too."

答言：「正使我父祖翁及和上有罪，尚不覆藏，況復叔父。  
He replied, "Even if my father, grandfather, or teacher had faults, I would not hide them, let alone for my uncle.

汝自可覆藏我和尚罪，我終不能覆藏汝罪。」  
You can cover for my teacher's faults if you wish, but I cannot hide yours."

優波難陀聞是語已，即作是念：「今日當令汝得苦惱事。」  
Having heard this, Upananda thought, "Today I will make you experience distress."

即共入城，到長者家。檀越見已，歡喜問訊，即請留食。  
They entered the city and reached the house of an elder. The host, upon seeing them, happily saluted them and invited them to stay for a meal.

優波難陀復作是念：「我當觀望日時欲至遣還精舍，令不及眾食，復失此供，進退失食時足得苦惱。」  
Upananda thought again, "I should delay until the time for returning to the monastery, so they miss the communal meal and lose this offering, thus causing distress from missing meals."

作是念已，時至即遣彼還。恐失食，故並看日時，疾疾而還。  
Having thought this, when the time came, he sent him back. Fearing missing the meal, he kept checking the time and hurried back.

眾食已訖，出祇洹門間傍佯經行，遙見彼來，口脣乾燥，似未得食。  
After the communal meal concluded, he wandered leisurely by the Jeta Grove gate, seeing him in the distance with dry lips, seeming as if he hadn't eaten.

即戲調言：「汝朝隨教化比丘入城，得何等種種美食？」  
He jokingly said, "You went to the city with the teaching monks in the morning; what various kinds of delicious food did you get?"

答言：「唯有苦惱，何處得食？」  
He replied, "Only distress; where could I have found food?"

諸比丘聞已，以是因緣，往白世尊。  
The monks, having heard this, reported it to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼優波難陀來。」來已，佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」  
The Buddha said, "Call Upananda here." After he came, the Buddha asked fully about the matter: "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」  
He answered, "Yes, it's true."

佛言：「此是惡事，非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。  
The Buddha said, "This is a wrongful act, against the Dharma and Vinaya, not as taught by the Buddha, and it cannot foster good qualities.

從今日後知比丘麁罪，不得覆藏。」  
From today on, if a monk knows another monk's serious fault, he must not cover it up."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。  
The Buddha told the monks, "All those residing in reliance on the city of Śrāvastī should gather, and for ten benefits, I will establish a rule for the monks so that even those who have heard it should hear it anew.

若比丘知他比丘犯麁罪，覆藏者，波夜提。」  
If a monk knows another monk has committed a serious fault and covers it up, it is a pācittika offense."




比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as stated above.




知者，若自知、若從他聞。
The wise know, either through self-awareness or from hearing others.




麁罪者，四波羅夷、十三僧伽婆尸沙，是名麁罪。
Serious offenses include the Four Parajikas and the Thirteen Sanghadisesas; these are called serious offenses.




覆藏者，不欲令他知。
The one who conceals does not want others to know.




波夜提者，如上說。  
Prajnaparamita is as stated above.




麁惡罪，不得覆藏。
If a monk sees another committing a serious offense, he is not allowed to conceal it.

覆藏者，波夜提。
If he conceals it, it is a Pācittiya offense.

應向人說，說時不得輒向人說，當向善比丘說，若同和上、阿闍梨。
He should speak to someone about it, but not to just anyone; he should speak to a virtuous monk, such as a teacher or a preceptor.

若彼犯罪比丘兇暴，若依王力、大臣力、兇惡人力、或起奪命因緣毀傷梵行者，應作是念：「彼罪行業必自有報，彼自應知。」
If the offending monk is violent, relies on the power of kings, ministers, or violent people, or causes harm leading to loss of life, he should think: "His bad actions will bring their own results; he should know for himself."

喻如失火，但自救身焉知餘事。」
It's like a fire breaking out; one only saves oneself and knows nothing of other matters.

爾時但護根相應無罪。
At that time, just guarding one's own roots is blameless.

若比丘知他比丘犯四事、十三僧伽婆尸沙，若一一覆藏者，波夜提。
If a monk knows another monk has committed one of the four Parajikas or the thirteen Sanghadisesas, and conceals even one, it is a Pācittiya offense.

三十尼薩耆、九十二波夜提，若一一覆藏者，越毘尼罪。
For the thirty Nissaggiyas and ninety-two Pācittiyas, if he conceals even one, it is a violation of the Vinaya.

四波羅提提舍尼、眾學法，一一覆藏者，越毘尼心悔。
For the four Patimokkha offenses and the Sekhiya rules, if he conceals even one, it is a matter for repentance in the Vinaya.

若覆藏比丘尼八波羅夷、十九僧伽婆尸沙，一一覆藏者，偷蘭遮。
If he conceals any of the eight Parajikas or the nineteen Sanghadisesas of a bhikkhuni, it is a Thullaccaya offense.

三十尼薩耆、百四十一波夜提，若一一覆藏者，越毘尼罪。

八波羅提提舍尼、眾學法，若一一覆藏者，越毘尼心悔。

式叉摩尼十八行法，更受學法，若一一覆藏者，越毘尼罪。
If he conceals any of the eighteen rules of the Sikkhamana or higher rules of training, it is a violation of the Vinaya.

沙彌、沙彌尼十戒，若一一覆藏，更與出家法，越毘尼罪。
For the ten precepts of a Sāmaṇera or Sāmaṇerī, if he conceals even one and grants ordination, it is a violation of the Vinaya.

下至俗人五戒，若一一覆藏者，越毘尼心悔。

是故說。
Thus it is explained


虫水及无衣， 
Insects and water reach where there are no clothes,

婬处屏处坐，
In lewd places, one's seat is screened,



往觀三軍陣，  
Go to view the three armies' formation,

打掌刀覆藏。  
Wield palms to conceal the blade.




第六跋渠竟。
The sixth Baqu has ended.




佛住毘舍離，廣說如上。  
The Buddha was staying at Vaisali, and he elaborated as above.

爾時有人著鎧持弓箭，入精舍中，脫鎧放仗止息樹下。  
At that time, there was a person wearing armor and holding a bow and arrows, who entered the monastery, removed the armor, laid down the weapons, and rested under a tree.

精舍中庭前沙地有眾鴿鳥，在中戲食。  
In the sandy area of the courtyard in front of the monastery, there were many doves, playing and feeding.

時尊者優陀夷見鳥已，即語：「長壽！借我弓箭試我手看。」  
Then, the venerable Uttara saw the birds and said, "Friend, lend me your bow and arrows to test my skill."

答言：「可爾。」  
The response was, "Alright."

即捉弓并注五箭，挽弓放發射殺五鴿，即取搣毛以木貫之，持授世尊：「此是鳥肉。」  
He took the bow and aimed five arrows, pulling the bow, releasing, and shooting to kill five doves. He then plucked them and skewered them on a stick, offering it to the World-Honored One: "This is bird meat."

佛言：「何處得？」  
The Buddha said, "Where did you get it?"

答言：「有人著鎧持弓箭至精舍庭前，止息樹下。從借弓箭，試手射鳥，本習射法猶故不失。」  
The response was, "Someone wearing armor and holding a bow and arrows came to the courtyard in front of the monastery, rested under a tree. I borrowed the bow and arrows to test my skill, and the skill I learned in the past has not been lost."

佛言：「癡人！此是惡法，應早捨棄，方言本習，手猶故在。汝常不聞，我以無量方便，毀訾殺生，讚歎不殺。  
The Buddha said, "Foolish person! This is an evil practice and should be abandoned promptly. You speak of past habits, yet your hands still engage in them. Have you not always heard how I, through countless methods, condemn killing and praise non-killing?

而今作是惡不善法，此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」  
Yet you now commit this evil and unskillful action, which is not in accordance with the law, the discipline, nor the Buddha's teachings, and it cannot nurture wholesome practices."

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！眾生應起慈心救護，云何優陀夷反奪其命而無慈心？」  
The monks said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One! Sentient beings should arouse a compassionate heart to protect life. How is it that Uttara instead takes life without compassion?"

佛言：「不但今日不起慈心，過去世時已曾如是。如《釋提桓因本生經》中廣說。」  
The Buddha said, "Not only today does he lack a compassionate heart, but he has done so in past lives as well, as explained extensively in the 'Discourse on Sakra's Previous Existences'."

佛告諸比丘：「依止毘舍離城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。  
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all those residing in Vaiśālī, and for the benefit of ten reasons, I will establish precepts for the monks, such that even those who have heard them should hear them again.

若比丘故奪畜生命，波夜提。」  
If a monk intentionally takes an animal's life, it is an offense requiring expiation."

，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, elaborating as above.

爾時六群比丘欲令十六群比丘疑悔故，作如是言：「世尊制戒，年滿二十聽受具足。
At that time, six groups of monks wanted to make the sixteen groups of monks doubtful and regretful, so they said, "The Buddha has established the rule that one must be twenty years old to receive full ordination.

汝等未滿二十而受具足，不名受具足。」
Since you have not yet reached twenty and have received full ordination, it is not considered full ordination."

聞是語已，即便大啼。
Upon hearing these words, they immediately wept loudly.

佛聞啼聲，知而故問：「是何等小兒啼聲？」
The Buddha heard the sound of weeping, knowingly asked, "What kind of children's weeping is this?"

比丘答言：「是六群比丘，欲令十六群比丘疑悔故，作如是言：『世尊制戒，年滿二十聽受具足。
The monks replied, "It is the six groups of monks who want to make the sixteen groups of monks doubtful and regretful, so they said: 'The Buddha has established the rule that one must be twenty years old to receive full ordination.

汝等未滿二十而受具足，非受具足。』
Since you have not yet reached twenty and have received full ordination, it is not full ordination.'

聞是語已，是故啼耳。」
Upon hearing these words, they wept because of it."

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已，佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」
After they came, the Buddha thoroughly asked about the matter, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "It is true."

佛言：「何故如是？」
The Buddha asked, "Why did you do this?"

答言：「我戲樂故。」
They replied, "For amusement."

佛言：「癡人！此是惡事，惱梵行人而言戲樂。」
The Buddha said, "Foolish people! This is a bad act, disturbing those who practice the holy life, yet you say it is for amusement."

佛言：「汝莫輕彼，彼若入定，以神足力能擲汝著他方世界。
The Buddha said, "Do not belittle them; if they enter deep meditation, with their spiritual power, they could cast you into another world.

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。
This is neither lawful, nor rational, nor in accordance with the Buddha's teachings, and cannot nurture the good dharma.

從今日後不聽令他比丘疑悔。」
From today onward, do not allow other monks to become doubtful and regretful."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "All who reside dependent on the city of Śrāvastī should gather; for the sake of ten benefits, I establish rules for the monks, and even those who have already heard should hear again.

若比丘故令他比丘起疑悔，須臾不樂，波夜提。」
If a monk deliberately causes other monks to become doubtful and regretful, experiencing even a moment of unhappiness, there is an offence of expiation."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as explained above.




故者，先作方便。
Concerning the past, prepare beforehand.




疑悔者，有七事：生、羯磨、形相、病、罪、罵詈、結使。
For those who have doubts, there are seven matters: birth, karma, appearance, illness, sin, insult, ensnarement.

Regarding appearance, it is said: "Elder! The World-Honored One set the precept that physical form must be complete for ordination, but you have a curved spine, are lame, blind, or have other physical inadequacies, thus not considered valid ordination."

Regarding sin, it is said: "Elder! The World-Honored One set the precept that only the pure may be ordained, but you have committed grave offenses like Pārājika, Saṅghādisesa, and others, thus not considered valid ordination."

作是語欲令疑悔。
Saying this is to instigate doubt.

Regarding insult, it is said: "Elder! The World-Honored One set the precept that the joyful may be ordained, but you were angry and insulting when ordained, thus not considered valid ordination."

若有人來欲受具足，若滿二十與受具足；

If someone comes wanting to receive full ordination, if they are twenty, they should be given full ordination;

若不滿者，語言：「且住！待滿二十。」

If they are not yet twenty, say to them: "Wait until you are twenty."

若彼便於餘處受具足來者，不得語令疑悔。

If they receive full ordination elsewhere and come, do not speak to cause them doubt or regret.

語者，越毘尼罪。

To speak is a Vinaya offense.

若比丘臨受具足時，若羯磨不成就，應彈指語言：「長老！汝羯磨不成就。」

If when a monk is about to receive full ordination, and the procedure is not accomplished, one should snap fingers and say: "Elder! Your procedure is not accomplished."

若臨時不語者，後不得語令起疑悔言：「汝受具足時白不成就、羯磨不成就、眾不成就。」

If one does not speak at the time, later one should not say anything to cause doubt or regret, such as: "When you received full ordination, the announcement was not accomplished, the procedure was not accomplished, the assembly was not accomplished."

語者，越毘尼罪。

To speak is a Vinaya offense.

若瞎眼、僂脊、脚跛身體不成就，未受具足者，應語言：「且爾住彼。」

If someone is blind, hunchbacked, or physically impaired, and has not received full ordination, one should say: "Remain there."

若於餘處受具足來者，不得語令疑悔。

If they receive full ordination elsewhere and come, do not speak to cause them doubt or regret.

語者，越毘尼罪。

To speak is a Vinaya offense.

若病人來欲受具足，應語：「且爾住。」

若彼便於餘處受具足來者，不得語令疑悔。

If they receive full ordination elsewhere and come, do not speak to cause them doubt or regret.

語者，越毘尼罪。

To speak is a Vinaya offense.

若疑悔比丘者，波夜提；比丘尼，偷蘭遮；

If it causes doubt or regret in a monk, it is a Pācittiya offense; for a nun, it is a Sthūlātyaya offense;

式叉摩尼、沙彌、沙彌尼者，越毘尼罪；

For a Śikṣamāṇā, a novice monk, or a novice nun, it is a Vinaya offense;

若俗人，越毘尼心悔。

If it is a layperson, it causes a guilty conscience.

是故說。

Thus it is spoken.



，廣說如上。
The Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, and spoke extensively as above.

爾時六群比丘數數易著衣，食前著一衣，食後著餘衣。
At that time, six groups of monks frequently changed their robes, wearing one before eating and another after.

佛知而故問：「是何等衣？」
The Buddha, knowing this, asked, "What kind of robes are these?"

答言：「是我淨施衣。」
They replied, "These are our pure offering robes."

佛言：「汝云何淨施衣與他，不捨而作三衣受用？
The Buddha said, "How can you call it a pure donated robe, give it to others, and not relinquish it to use it as the three robes?

從今日後不聽淨施衣不捨而受用。」
From today onwards, you are not allowed to keep the donated robes without giving them up and make use of them."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Let all residing in Śrāvastī gather; for the sake of ten benefits, I will establish a rule for the monks, and even those who have heard it before shall hear it again."

若比丘與比丘、比丘尼、式叉摩尼、沙彌、沙彌尼衣，後不捨而受用者，波夜提。
If a monk gives a robe to another monk, nun, probationary nun, male novice, or female novice, and later does not give it up and continues to use it, it is a Pācittiya offense.



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as mentioned above.




與者，淨施與五種人。
Giving is pure when shared with five kinds of individuals.




不捨者，後不捨。
Those who are unwilling to let go now will remain unwilling to let go in the future.




受用者，作三衣受用，波夜提。
A user, using three robes, transgresses a petty offense.




波夜提者，如上說。
Poya better is as aforementioned.




若比丘有多衣，忘不識，應取一切衣集著一處，

If a monk has many robes and forgets or does not recognize them, he should gather all the robes in one place.

當捨作是言：「此衣淨施與某甲，某甲於我不計意，今還捨。」

Then he should make a declaration: "I offer this robe pure to so-and-so, so-and-so has no investment in me, and now I give it back."

若是三衣者應別捨：「是我三衣數，此僧伽梨先受持，今捨。」

If it is part of the three robes, he should additionally say: "This is one of my three robes, this Sanghati I previously held, now I relinquish it."

「此僧伽梨，是我三衣數，今受持。」

"This Sanghati, it is one of my three robes, I hold it now."

「此欝多羅僧，是我三衣數，先受持，今捨。」

"This Uttarasanga, it is one of my three robes, I held it before, now I relinquish it."

「此欝多羅僧，是我三衣數，今受持。」

"This Uttarasanga, it is one of my three robes, I hold it now."

「此安陀會，是我三衣數，先受持，今捨。」

"This Antara Vasa, it is one of my three robes, I held it before, now I relinquish it."

「此安陀會是我三衣數，今受持。」

"This Antara Vasa, it is one of my three robes, I hold it now."

「此是我三衣數，不離宿受持。」

"This is my set of three robes, and I hold them without staying apart overnight."

餘衣長二肘，廣一肘以上，盡應淨施。

Other robes more than two cubits long and one cubit wide should be completely offered.

淨施法者，作是言：「長老！我此長衣施與某甲，某甲於我不計意，若浣染時縫時，有因緣事，我當捨用。」

The method of pure offering is making this statement: "Elder! I offer this long robe to so-and-so, so-and-so has no investment in me. When washing, dyeing, sewing, or during occasions, I will give it up for use."

受持已，淨施已著衣架上，日日當憶念記識。

Once received and purely offered, place it on the robe rack and remember it daily.

若忘者，當語共行弟子、依止弟子：「此是我三衣，汝當日日助我憶識。」

If forgotten, tell a fellow disciple or dependent disciple: "This is my three robes, you must help me remember it every day."

若無弟子者，應衣角頭書作字。

If there is no disciple, write marks on the corner of the robe.

若自身對面淨施不捨而受用者，波夜提。

If one does not relinquish but uses a robe offered face-to-face, it leads to a Pācittiya offense.

若不對面而自說淨施，不捨而受用者，越毘尼罪。

If one declares the pure offering not face-to-face, does not relinquish, and uses it, it is a transgression of Vinaya.

若對他面淨施，不捨而受用者，波夜提。

If one offers to others face-to-face, does not relinquish and uses it, it leads to a Pācittiya offense.

復對餘人，不捨受用者，波夜提。

If repeatedly to others, does not relinquish and uses, it leads to a Pācittiya offense.

不識衣，越毘尼罪。

Not recognizing the robe is a transgression of Vinaya.

無三衣，越毘尼罪。

Not having the three robes is a transgression of Vinaya.

一時捨、一時受，越毘尼罪。

Giving up and taking back at the same time is a transgression of Vinaya.

不捨，作三衣受用，波夜提。

Not relinquishing, but using as the three robes, leads to a Pācittiya offense.

不捨，作塔用、僧用、與人，越毘尼罪。

Not relinquishing, using as offerings or for the Sangha or given to people is a transgression of Vinaya.

不得對面前說淨施，當餘人邊說淨施，是故說。

One should not declare a pure offering face-to-face, but next to others, thus it is said.



，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, broadly speaking as above.

爾時六群比丘食前取他僧伽梨、取他鉢藏著異處。
At that time, six groups of monks would take others' robes and bowls before meals and hide them in different places.

是比丘乞食時到，欲入聚落，求僧伽梨不得。
When these monks went to beg for food and wanted to enter the village, they couldn't find their robes.

復有比丘求鉢不得，是比丘問諸比丘長老：「誰持我僧伽梨去？」
Another monk couldn't find his bowl, and these monks asked the elders: "Who took my robe?"

復問：「誰持我鉢去？」
Then they asked, "Who took my bowl?"

時六群比丘便笑言：「長老！此僧伽藍大，但求之。」
The six groups of monks laughed and said, "Elders! The monastery is large; just search for it."

即求，經久不得。
They searched for a long time but couldn't find it.

復言：「長老！雇我何物？當助汝求。」
They said again, "Elders! What will you hire me with? I will help you search."

聞是語已，知是彼藏。
Upon hearing this, they knew it was hidden by those monks.

食後復藏尼師檀及鍼筒。
After the meal, they hid the sitting mats and needle cases again.

諸比丘食已，欲林中坐禪，求尼師檀不得，即言：「長老！誰持我尼師檀去。」
After the meal, the monks wanted to meditate in the forest but couldn't find their sitting mats, so they asked, "Elders! Who took my sitting mat?"

復有比丘言：「誰持我鍼筒去？」
Again, a monk asked, "Who took my needle case?"

六群比丘笑言：「長老！此僧伽藍大，但遍求。」
The six groups of monks laughed and said, "Elders! The monastery is large; just search all over."

即求，經久不得。
They searched again for a long time but couldn't find it.

復語言：「汝雇我何物？當助汝求。」
They said again, "What will you hire us with? We will help you search."

聞是語已，知是彼藏。
Upon hearing this, they knew it was those monks who hid it.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The monks went to the Blessed One because of this cause, and the Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」
After they came, the Buddha asked about the above matter: "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「何以故爾？」
The Buddha asked, "Why did you do this?"

答言：「為戲樂故。」
They replied, "For entertainment."

佛言：「癡人！此是惡事，惱諸梵行人而言戲樂。」
The Buddha said, "Foolish people! This is a bad deed, disturbing the holy practitioners and calling it entertainment."

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。
This is not Dharma, not discipline, not how the Buddha teaches, and cannot nurture good dharma.

佛言：「從今已後不聽戲笑藏他衣鉢、尼師檀、鍼筒。」
The Buddha said, "From now on, do not allow the mocking and hiding of others' robes, bowls, sitting mats, or needle cases."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Those residing in Shravasti should all come together. For the benefit of ten areas, I prescribe this precept for the monks so that even those who have heard will hear it again."

若比丘藏他衣鉢、尼師檀、鍼筒，乃至戲笑，波夜提。
If a monk hides others' robes, bowls, sitting mats, or needle cases, even in jest, it is a varjita offense.


比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhus, as mentioned above.




衣者，七種衣也。
Clothing, there are seven kinds of clothing.




鉢者，瓦鉢、鐵鉢。

Pots are clay pots and iron pots.

鉢有三種：上、中、下。

For the one who follows the precepts, as the World Honored One has taught.




鍼筒者，筒中有鍼。
A needle case is one that contains needles.




藏者，若自藏、若使人藏，乃至戲笑，波夜提。
If someone hides something themselves, or instructs others to hide it, even as a joke, it is an offense of expiation.




波夜提者，如上說。
A bo-yat, as mentioned above.




一一衣者，波夜提。
If in the three robes, one robe is hidden, it is a Pārājika.

若僧祇支及餘衣等，越毘尼罪。
If it is the Saṃghāṭi or other garments, it is a breach of Vinaya.

三種鉢中若一一藏，波夜提。
If one bowl is hidden among the three bowls, it is a Pārājika.

若鍵鎡及餘器，越毘尼罪。
If it is a key or other utensils, it is a breach of Vinaya.

If a nissīdana is hidden, it is a Pārājika.

戲笑藏比丘衣，波夜提；
Jokingly hiding a monk's robe, it is a Pārājika;

比丘尼，偷蘭遮；
For a nun, it is a Śrāmaṇera;

式叉摩尼、沙彌、沙彌尼，越毘尼罪；
For a Śikṣamāṇā, novice monk, or novice nun, it is a breach of Vinaya;

下至俗人，越毘尼心悔。
Even for laypeople, it is a breach of Vinaya to be regretted.

是故說。
Thus it is said.




，廣說如上。  
The Buddha was residing in Shravasti, widely preaching as above.

爾時六群比丘從禪坊中起，在屏處闇地立，悚耳皺面、反眼吐舌，作喡喡聲恐怖十六群比丘。  
At that time, six groups of monks got up from the meditation hall, stood in a dark place off to the side, raised their eyebrows, rolled their eyes, stuck out their tongues, and made scary noises to frighten sixteen groups of monks.

十六群比丘聞已，即心恐怖舉聲啼喚。  
Upon hearing this, the sixteen groups of monks became scared, raised their voices, and cried out.

佛知而故問：「是何等小兒啼聲？」  
The Buddha, knowing this, intentionally asked, "What children's crying is this?"

諸比丘以是因緣具白世尊。  
The monks reported the cause of the situation in detail to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」  
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已，佛問六群比丘：「汝實爾不？」  
Once they arrived, the Buddha asked the six groups of monks, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」  
They replied, "It is true."

佛言：「何以故爾？」  
The Buddha said, "Why did you do this?"

答言：「戲樂故。」  
They answered, "For amusement."

佛言：「癡人！此是惡事，惱梵行人而言戲樂。」  
The Buddha said, "Foolish people! This is an evil act, claiming amusement but troubling those who practice the pure life."

佛言：「汝莫輕彼，彼若入定，能以神力擲汝著他方世界。  
The Buddha said, "Do not underestimate them, if they enter meditation, they can use their spiritual power to fling you to another world.

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」  
This is neither lawful, nor according to the discipline, nor as the Buddha’s teachings, and should not be used to nurture good dharma."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。  
The Buddha told all the monks, "All residing in Shravasti should gather, for the purpose of ten benefits, I will prescribe a rule of discipline for the monks, so that even those who have heard it before will hear it again.

若比丘恐怖比丘者，波夜提。」  
If a monk causes fear to another monk, it is an offense requiring confession.


比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as said above.




恐怖者，色聲香味觸，波夜提。
For those who are afraid, form, sound, scent, taste, touch are waves at night.

Thus it is said.




，為諸天世人之所供養，多所利益。
The Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti, worshipped by gods and people, bringing great benefits.

爾時舍衛城中有姊妹二人，妊身未產，在家有信出家為道。
At that time, there were two sisters in Shravasti, pregnant but not yet giving birth, who had faith and ordained as nuns.

諸比丘尼見其腹相，即便驅出，以是因緣往白世尊。
The nuns saw their pregnant state and expelled them, bringing this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「在家妊身無罪。」
The Buddha said: "Being pregnant at home is not a sin."

此比丘尼後生男兒，字童子迦葉，至年八歲出家為道，成阿羅漢。
This nun later gave birth to a boy named Kumara Kashyapa, who ordained at the age of eight and became an Arhat.

共十六群比丘，各持澡盥，到阿耆羅河邊澡浴入水，仰覆浮戲渡河來往，拍水沐浴。
Together with sixteen groups of monks, each carrying a wash basin, they bathed in the Ajiravatī River, floating and playing, bathing in the water.

爾時波斯匿王在重樓閣上，四望觀看。
At that time, King Pasenadi of Kosala was on a high pavilion, looking around.

王未信佛法，見是事已，倍生不信，即語末利夫人言：「看汝家所事福田。」
The king did not have faith in the Buddha's teachings and, seeing this, doubted even more, saying to Queen Mallika: "Look at the field of merit you serve."

夫人深信無疑，不迴顧看即答言：「大王！或是年少出家始受具足，未知戒律，或世尊未制此戒，是故爾耳。」
The queen, deeply faithful, without looking back, replied: "Great King! Perhaps these are young monks newly ordained, not yet versed in the precepts, or the Blessed One has not yet set this rule."

王語夫人言：「喻如家長語時，眷屬隨從。如和上、阿闍梨語時，弟子隨從。
The king said to the queen: "Just as when the head of the family speaks, the members follow; when the teacher speaks, the disciples follow.

沙門瞿曇語時，弟子皆言：『如是。世尊！如是。修伽陀！』
When the ascetic Gautama speaks, the disciples all say: 'So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Sugata!'

我共汝語，而汝不迴顧看。」
I speak with you, yet you do not look back."

爾時尊者童子迦葉，於其水中入頂第四禪，以天耳聞王語聲，即語諸伴比丘作是言：「長老！王倍生不信。
At that time, the venerable Kumara Kashyapa, entering the fourth jhana in the water, heard the king's words with his divine ear and said to the fellow monks: "Elders! The king has doubled his lack of faith.

末利夫人心生不悅，今當令彼發歡喜心。」
Queen Mallika is unhappy; now let us make her delighted."

皆言：「善哉！」
They all said: "Good indeed!"

各各即提澡盥盛滿中水，以著於前，結跏趺坐，次第行列陵虛而逝，於王殿上空中而過。
Each filled their wash basin with water, placed it before them, sat in the lotus posture, and took flight one after another, passing over the king's hall in the sky.

時末利夫人在露處坐，見其坐影已，即便仰觀，見次第行列結跏趺坐前，皆有澡盥乘虛而去似如鴈王。
At that time, Queen Mallika was sitting in the open air; she saw their shadows and looked up, seeing them proceed orderly in lotus posture, each with a wash basin, soaring like king geese.

見是事已，心大歡喜，即白王言：「看我家福田神德如是。」
Seeing this, she was greatly pleased and said to the king: "Look at the spiritual might of our field of merit."

王見已，心大歡喜，作如是言：「善哉！我得善利，願世尊及比丘僧盡壽在我國內，為良福田。」
The king, seeing this, was greatly pleased and said: "Good indeed! I have gained great benefit, wishing the Blessed One and the Sangha to remain lifelong in my realm as an excellent field of merit."

諸比丘聞王嫌故，以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks, hearing the king's complaint, took this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼十六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said: "Call the sixteen groups of monks."

來已，佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」
They came, and the Buddha asked them in detail: "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered: "It is true."

佛言：「我今罰汝，因汝當為諸比丘制戒。」
The Buddha said: "I now reprimand you, and because of you, I will establish a rule for the monks."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks: "Let all residing in Shravasti gather; for ten benefits, I establish a rule for the monks, even those who have heard it must hear it again.

，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti and expounded extensively as above.

爾時月八日、十四日、十五日、齋日，比丘尼來詣佛所，頭面禮拜問訊。
On the 8th, 14th, and 15th days of the month, during the fasting day, Bhikkhunis came to the Buddha, paid homage, and inquired after his well-being.

時十六群比丘去佛不遠，在一處坐，優鉢羅比丘尼、脂梨沙彌尼，亦來禮拜問訊。
At that time, sixteen groups of Bhikkhus were sitting not far from the Buddha, and Bhikkhunis Uppala and Sharipa came to pay homage and inquire.

禮拜問訊已，往十六群比丘所，以同年少相好樂故，至彼中坐。
After paying respects, they went to the group of sixteen bhikkhus, sat among them due to similar youthful preferences.

坐不正故，彼見已更相指示而笑。
As they did not sit properly, others noticed and pointed it out to each other while laughing.

時有婆羅門極醜陋、僂脊㑌脚，將一年少端正婦來見，諸比丘笑已，作是念：「此諸沙門見我醜陋，將端正婦，必當笑我。」
Then there was a very ugly Brahmin, with a hunched back and limp legs, leading a young and beautiful woman, seeing whom the bhikkhus laughed thinking, "These ascetics see me ugly and with a beautiful woman, they must be laughing at me."

即瞋恚言：「沙門釋子不知儀則，而形笑我。」
He angrily said, "These ascetics, disciples of Shakyamuni, don't know etiquette and mock me."

諸比丘即答言：「我不笑汝。」
The bhikkhus immediately replied, "We are not laughing at you."

婆羅門言：「不爾！正笑我耳。」
The Brahmin said, "Not so! You are indeed laughing at me."

作是語已，往至佛所，作是言：「奇異！瞿曇！沙門釋子不知儀則，見我醜陋，將端正婦而形笑我。」
Saying thus, he went to the Buddha and said, "Strange! Gautama! The disciples of Shakyamuni lack etiquette, seeing my ugliness and my beautiful wife, they mocked me."

佛即與婆羅門隨順說法示教利喜，歡悅而去。
The Buddha then spoke teachings to the Brahmin with harmony, guidance, benefit, and joy, and he left happily.

去已佛言：「呼十六群比丘來。」
After he left, the Buddha said, "Call the sixteen groups of bhikkhus here."

來已，佛問比丘：「有婆羅門極醜陋，將端正婦，汝見已實笑不？」
When they came, the Buddha asked, "There was a very ugly Brahmin bringing a beautiful woman, did you really laugh at him?"

答言：「不笑婆羅門。」
They replied, "We didn't laugh at the Brahmin."

「汝笑誰？」
"Who did you laugh at then?"

答言：「世尊！齋日優鉢羅比丘尼、脂梨沙彌尼來到我所，坐不正故，我見已互相指示，是故笑耳。」
They replied, "World Honored One! On the fasting day, Bhikkhunis Uppala and Sharipa came to us, didn't sit properly, we noticed it and pointed it to each other, that's why we laughed."

佛言：「梵行尼坐不正，汝當方便令起，云何笑之？今當罰汝，因是為諸弟子制戒。」
The Buddha said, "If the Bhikkhunis do not sit properly, you should skillfully help them rise, how could you laugh? Now I will punish you, and because of this, lay down a rule for the disciples."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the bhikkhus, "All who are residing in Shravasti should gather. For the benefit of ten reasons, I will lay down a rule for the bhikkhus, even those who have already heard should hear again."

若比丘以指相指，波夜提。
If a bhikkhu points at another with a finger, it is an offense of expiation.

比丘者，如上說。以一指指，波夜提。
For a bhikkhu, as stated above. If pointing with one finger, it is an offense of expiation.

乃至五指亦如是。一切手指，波夜提。
Even up to five fingers, it is the same. All pointing with hands is an offense of expiation.

以拳指，偷蘭遮。
Pointing with a fist is an offense of wrongdoing.

若木、若竹指，越毘尼罪。
Pointing with wood or bamboo is an offense against the disciplinary code.

若比丘共諍，以指相指，波夜提。
If bhikkhus argue and point at each other, it's an offense of expiation.

若直月、若知事人差次食，以指指言：「某甲去。」波夜提。
If during a sacred month or for a steward assigning meals, one points and says, "This one may go," it is an offense of expiation.

若捉竹木指，越毘尼罪。
Holding bamboo or wood to point is an offense against the disciplinary code.

應語言：「某甲，當次食去。」
One should say, "This person, please proceed for your turn to eat."

若沙彌眠，欲喚起者，應彈指。
If a novice is asleep and one wants to wake him, they should snap their fingers.

若不覺者，不得以指挃，當牽衣挽令覺。
If he does not wake, one should not use fingers to poke, but should pull his robe to wake him.

若諸比丘在俗人家坐，摩訶羅比丘坐不正者，應語：「汝正坐。」
If bhikkhus are sitting in a layperson's house and Bhikkhu Maharaja is not sitting properly, one should say, "Sit properly."

若不覺者，應語：「正汝衣。」
If he doesn't notice, one should say, "Adjust your robe."

復不覺者，應語言：「摩訶羅覆汝形體。」
If still he doesn't notice, one should say, "Maharaja, cover your body."

若比丘至比丘尼精舍中坐，比丘尼禮比丘足已，在比丘前坐。
If a bhikkhu goes to a bhikkhuni's dwelling and the bhikkhuni pays homage at his feet and then sits before him.

若坐不正者，不得語令慚愧，應作方便令起取物。
If she does not sit properly, one should not reproach to cause shame but gently cause her to rise to fetch something.

若檀越家坐，婦女來禮比丘足，在前坐不正者，不得語令慚愧，當作方便發遣取物。
If at a lay supporter’s house, and a woman comes to pay homage at a bhikkhu's feet and sits improperly, one should not reproach to shame, but gently make her rise to fetch something.

若奸婬女來試弄比丘，故不正坐者，不得語，但當避去。
If a loose woman comes to test a bhikkhu, sitting improperly on purpose, one should not speak but simply leave.

是故說。
Thus it is spoken


佛住毘舍離，廣說如上。
Buddha stayed in Vaishali and widely preached as above.

時有一人其婦不可意，瞋恚極打便出。
At that time, there was a man whose wife displeased him, and in extreme anger, he severely beat her and drove her out.

婦作是念：「彼瞋不息，若更打者定死無疑，今當走避。」
The wife thought, "His anger hasn't subsided; if he beats me again, I will surely die without a doubt, so I must flee."

即便出門。
She immediately left her home.

見有比丘乞食還欲出城，婦人即問言：「阿闍梨欲何處去？」
She saw a monk returning after begging for alms and about to leave the city, and she asked him, "Master, where are you going?"

答言：「欲出城去。」
He replied, "I intend to leave the city."

婦人言：「我欲隨尊去。」
The woman said, "I wish to follow you, Sir."

比丘言：「姊妹！此是王道何為見問？」
The monk said, "Sister! This is the King's path, why ask me?"

即隨後去。
She then followed behind him.

其夫後作是念：「我婦得打，或能走去。」
Later, the husband thought, "I beat my wife, she might have run away."

即入不見其婦，即問餘人言：「何處去？」
He went inside and did not see his wife, so he asked others, "Where did she go?"

答言：「適出隨是道去。」
They replied, "She just left and went down this path."

即從後逐，見其婦隨比丘後去，即生瞋恚，作是罵言：「弊惡沙門誘我婦去。」
He chased after and saw his wife following the monk, immediately becoming angry and shouted, "You vile ascetic, you lured my wife away."

便捉比丘熟打，將詣斷事官所，作是言：「此比丘誘我婦去。」
He seized the monk, beat him severely, and took him to the officials, saying, "This monk lured my wife away."

斷事人言：「一一將來撿問事實。」
The official said, "Bring them one by one to question the facts."

即問比丘：「汝出家人云何將他婦走？」
He then asked the monk, "How did you, a monk, bring away another man's wife?"

答言：「不爾。」
The monk replied, "I did not."

「何因相隨？」
"Why is she following you?"

答言：「我乞食還欲出城去，婦人問我：『欲何處去？』
The monk replied, "I was begging for alms and was about to leave the city, when the woman asked me, 'Where are you going?'

我答言：『欲出城去。』婦人言：『我欲隨出。』
I replied, 'I intend to leave the city.' The woman said, 'I wish to follow.'

我答言：『姊妹！此是王道何用見問？』事實如是。」
I said, 'Sister! This is the King's path, why ask me?' These are the facts."

斷事人言：「將比丘出，喚婦人來。」
The official said, "Take the monk out and call the woman in."

問言：「是沙門偷汝去耶？」
He asked, "Did the monk steal you away?"

答言：「不爾。」
She replied, "No."

「何因相隨。」
"Why are you following him?"

答言：「夫主見打，以夫瞋未息，復恐重打，因懼失命故，是故避走。
She replied, "My husband beat me, and as his anger had not subsided, I feared he would beat me again and I might die, so I fled.

遇見比丘，即問言：『尊者何處去？』答言：『我欲出城。』
I met the monk and asked, 'Sir, where are you going?' He replied, 'I intend to leave the city.'

我言：『欲隨尊去。』比丘言：『此是王道何用見問？
I said, 'I wish to follow you, Sir.' The monk said, 'This is the King's path, why ask me?

』事實如是，非彼所偷。」
These are the facts, he did not steal me."

即遣婦人出，復呼比丘來，問言：「汝出家人偷他婦去。
The official then sent the woman out, called the monk back in, and asked, "You, a monk, stole someone's wife away.

云何妄語望得脫耶？向者女人言：『汝實偷。』汝何言不？」
How did you hope to escape with lies? The woman previously said, 'You did steal.' Why do you deny it?"

比丘答言：「不爾。」
The monk replied, "I did not."

復更重問，答辭如初。
He questioned him again, and the answer was the same as before.

遣比丘出，復喚女人問言：「弊死女人，棄夫逃走，妄語欺官望得脫耶？
He sent the monk out and called the woman again, asking, "You vile woman, abandoning your husband and fleeing, do you hope to deceive the officials with lies?

向者比丘言：『實偷汝。』汝何言不？」
The monk previously said, 'Indeed, I stole you.' Why do you deny it?"

答言：「實不爾。」
She replied, "This is truly not the case."

如是三問，答辭如初。
Thus, he questioned thrice, and the answer remained unchanged.

即留女人喚比丘來，對驗情狀，觀望顏色知其虛實，答辭如初。
He retained the woman, called the monk, and observed their expressions to understand the truth, and the answers remained unchanged.

官問比丘：「汝鉢何以破？」
The official asked the monk, "Why is your bowl broken?"

答言：「破耳。」
The monk replied, "It is simply broken."

「衣何故裂壞？」
"Why is your robe torn?"

答言：「裂耳。」
The monk replied, "It is simply torn."

「肘膝何以傷破？」
"Why are your elbows and knees bruised?"

答言：「傷耳。」
The monk replied, "They are simply bruised."

婦瞋夫未息，憐彼比丘受苦如是而不語官，即向官說。
The wife, feeling compassion for the monk who suffered without speaking to the officer, spoke up.

官聞是已，極大瞋恚，作如是言：「弊惡罪人！汝便是王更無餘人。」
Upon hearing this, the official was extremely angry and said, "You vile criminal! Are you the king with no one above you?"

即勅官人料理比丘，給其湯藥，與其衣鉢。
He immediately ordered officials to tend to the monk, providing him with medicine and clothes.

即取是人繫著獄中，籍家財物沒入官庫。
The man was then imprisoned, and his property confiscated by the state.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks reported this incident to the Blessed One.

佛語比丘：「何處一切王家得是信心？
The Buddha said to the monks, "Where does any royal household find faith?

此不與共期，過患如是，況復共期？
Not accompanying them causes such troubles, let alone accompanying them?

從今日後不聽與女人共期道行。
From today onwards, monks are not allowed to travel with women by mutual agreement."

佛告諸比丘：依止毘舍離城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks in Vaishali to gather for the promulgation of a rule beneficial in ten ways, so that all who have heard it may hear it again.

若比丘與女人共期道行，乃至聚落中間，波夜提。
If a monk and a woman travel together by agreement, even between villages, it constitutes a serious offense.



比丘者，如上說。  
A monk, as stated above.  




女人者，若母、若姊妹、若大、若小、在家、出家。
Women, whether mothers, sisters, older, younger, at home, or out.




今天约定的人，可能是今天，可能是明天，可能是半个月后，可能是一个月后。
The one we have an appointment with, perhaps is today, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps in half a month, perhaps in a month.




道者，三由延、兩由延、一由延、半由延、一拘盧舍、半拘盧舍，乃至聚落中間者，波夜提。
The path, whether it is three yojanas, two yojanas, one yojana, half a yojana, one krosha, a half krosha, or as far as between villages, leads to Prājñā.




波夜提者，如上說。
Boya, as mentioned above.




若比丘與女人共期道行，經一一聚落中間，一一波夜提。
If a monk travels with a woman through each village, it results in a "pācittiya" offense for each instance.

若還來者，亦一一波夜提。
If he returns, it also results in a "pācittiya" offense for each instance.

餘如九十二第三跋渠中與比丘尼共期著道行中廣說，此中以女人為異耳。
The rest is explained in the ninety-second rule about traveling with a nun, the difference here is regarding a woman.

是故說。
Therefore, it is said.



佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti and broadly spoke as above.




那律在塔山夏安居竟，還舍衛城禮覲問訊世尊。

At that time, Venerable Aniruddha finished the summer retreat at Mount Tower and returned to Sravasti City to pay respects and inquire about the World Honored One.

行路中間日冥欲入聚落求宿止處。

On the way, as it was getting dark, he wanted to enter a settlement to seek a place to stay.

時聚落中有一母人，將一女欲出村取水，道路相逢。

At that time, there was a woman in the settlement who was taking her daughter to fetch water, and they met on the road.

女見比丘顏貌端正威儀庠序，即生慾想。

The girl saw that the monk had an upright appearance and dignified demeanor, and immediately developed desire.

比丘入聚落，遍求宿處不得，作是念：「當還出外於樹下宿。」

The monk entered the settlement, but could not find a place to stay, and thought, "I should return outside and sleep under a tree."

即便還出，復逢彼母子。

He then went back outside and again encountered the mother and daughter.

時女問母言：「此沙門向冥欲何處去？」

At that time, the girl asked her mother, "Where is this monk going in the dark?"

答言：「不知。」

She replied, "I don't know."

女言：「阿母可問。」

The girl said, "Mother, please ask."

母即問言：「沙門向冥出聚落欲至何所？」

The mother then asked, "Monk, where are you headed to in the dark outside the settlement?"

答言：「我入聚落求宿處不得，欲還出外樹下止宿。」

He replied, "I entered the settlement to find a place to stay but couldn't, so I want to go outside and sleep under a tree."

女語母言：「可將歸家借其宿處。」

The girl said to her mother, "We can take him home and lend him a place to stay."

母即語言：「沙門隨我還家，當借宿處。」

The mother then said, "Monk, follow me home, and we'll lend you a place to stay."

比丘即隨還至家，與一房語言：「沙門此中可宿。」

The monk then followed them home, and they gave him a room, saying, "Monk, you can stay here."

比丘即敷草蓐結跏趺坐。

The monk then spread some grass mats and sat in a cross-legged position.

母子食訖，還自眠處。

The mother and daughter finished eating and went back to their own sleeping places.

是比丘道行疲極偃息而臥，女伺母眠熟已，徐徐竊起至比丘所牽其草蓐。

The monk was extremely tired from traveling, lay down to rest, and the girl waited until her mother was asleep, then quietly got up and went to the monk, pulling at his grass mat.

比丘覺已，起正身坐，女人性弱即便却去。

The monk woke up, sat up straight, and the woman, being timid, immediately left.

去已比丘還復臥，此女須臾復來。

After she left, the monk lay down again, and shortly the girl came back again.

如世尊所說，有五種人夜多不眠。

As the World Honored One said, there are five types of people who often stay awake at night.

何等五？女人起欲想憶男子故夜多不眠，男子起欲想憶女人故夜多不眠，賊有盜心夜多不眠，王憂念國事故夜多不眠，精進比丘修習道業夜多不眠。

Which five? Women who have lustful thoughts and remember men often stay awake at night, men who have lustful thoughts and remember women often stay awake at night, thieves who have intentions of stealing often stay awake at night, kings who worry about state affairs often stay awake at night, and diligent monks practicing the path often stay awake at night.

此女人不得眠，復竊起來牽其草蓐。

This woman could not sleep, and again quietly got up and pulled at the monk's grass mat.

比丘覺已起正身坐，乃至夜了。

The monk woke up and sat up straight, until the night was over.

明日至佛所，佛遙見已，知而故問：「誰嬈觸汝，顏色不悅？」

The next day he went to the Buddha, and the Buddha saw him from afar, knowing and intentionally asked, "Who disturbed you, why is your expression displeased?"

即以上事具白世尊。

He then reported the matter in full to the World Honored One.

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」

The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all those residing in Sravasti City, and for ten benefits, lay down precepts for the monks, even those who have heard should hear again."

若比丘與女人同室宿，波夜提。

If a monk stays overnight in the same room with a woman, it is an offense of expiation


比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu, as stated above.




女人者，若母、姊妹、若大、若小、在家、出家。
Women, whether mothers, sisters, older, younger, at home, or leaving home.




室者，同障同覆。
A house is the same in its walls and its roof.

佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, extensively teaching as above.

爾時尊者優陀夷，與一知識同聚落婆羅門。
At that time, the venerable Udayin was associated with a Brahman of the same village.

婆羅門女出嫁，至異聚落，遣信語父：「若阿闍梨，時時來看我。」
The Brahman woman's daughter got married to someone from a different village and sent a message to her father: "If the teacher could visit me from time to time."

如二不定法中，因緣廣說。
As stipulated in the two indefinite rules, the causes are extensively described.

乃至佛告：「優陀夷癡人！
Then the Buddha said, "Udayin, you foolish man!

在家俗人尚知出家人所應行法、不應行法，
Even laypeople know which practices are appropriate or inappropriate for those who have renounced the world.

汝信心出家而不知出家所應行法？
You renounce the world with faith but do not know the practices expected of a renunciant?

此非法？非律？非如佛教，
Is this not against the Dharma? Against discipline? Not according to the Buddha's teachings?

不可以是長養善法。
This cannot nurture good practices.

從今日後不聽共女人獨空靜處坐。」
From today onward, it's not allowed to sit alone with women in secluded places."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，
The Buddha told the monks, "Let all who reside depending on Śrāvastī assemble together,

以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
For the sake of ten benefits, rules are established for the monks, and even those who have heard them before should hear them again.

若比丘與女人獨空靜處坐，波夜提。」
If a monk sits alone with a woman in a secluded place, it is a Pācittiya offense."



比丘者，如上說。
A Bhikkhu, as previously stated.




女人者，若母、姊妹、若大、若小、在家、出家。
Women, whether mothers or sisters, whether older or younger, whether at home or away.




獨者，獨一女人，更無餘人。
Alone, a solitary woman, with no one else.

設有餘人，若眠、癡狂、心亂、苦痛、嬰兒、非人、畜生，
If there were others, they would be asleep, deranged, confused, suffering, infants, non-humans, or animals,

雖有是人，故名獨。
Even if such people exist, she is called solitary.




空靜者，寂靜處。
The tranquil one, a quiet place.




坐者。共坐，波夜提。
One sits. Sitting together: a transgression.




波夜提者，如上說。

Poya Ti implies, as mentioned above.




若比丘與女人共坐，竟日坐者，一波夜提。
If a monk sits with a woman for a whole day, it is an offense of expiation.

若比丘、女人中間起，更坐，一一波夜提。
If a monk gets up and sits again in-between with a woman, each time it is an offense of expiation.

若比丘受請到檀越家坐，女人下食已坐比丘前，復起益食。
If a monk accepts an invitation and sits at the donor's house, and the woman serves food and sits in front of the monk, and then gets up to serve more food.

如是復起復坐，一一波夜提。
This repeated getting up and sitting down, each time is an offense of expiation.

一女人比丘邊坐，一女人來往益食，女人出時比丘應起。
If one woman sits beside a monk, and another woman goes back and forth serving food, the monk should get up when the woman leaves.

起時不得輒爾起，恐彼女疑，謂呼比丘有異想，應先語：「姊妹！我欲起。」
He should not get up abruptly, to avoid causing suspicion; he should first say, "Sister! I want to get up."

問言：「何故起？」答言：「世尊制戒，不聽共女人獨空靜處坐，是故起耳。」
If asked, "Why get up?" he should reply, "The Buddha set this rule; we are not allowed to sit alone in a secluded place with a woman. That is why I'm getting up."

女言：「尊者莫起，我自起。」起者無罪。
If the woman says, "Venerable sir, don't get up; I will get up myself," there is no offense for getting up.

減七歲女在階道板上坐，坐已復第二板上坐，坐已復起第三板上坐，如是一一徙處坐，一一波夜提。
If a girl under seven sits on a step board, and after sitting moves to a second, and then a third, each relocation is an offense of expiation.

若家中作務淨人來往不斷者，無罪。
If a person involved in household chores continuously comes and goes, there is no offense.

若門向道，道中行人如比丘乞食頃不斷，彼即當淨人，無罪。
If a door faces the path and people continuously pass by, like monks begging for alms, they are considered guardians and there is no offense.

若比丘、女人於閣上共坐，閣下淨人遙見比丘，比丘亦見淨人，無罪。
If a monk and a woman sit together on a pavilion, and a guardian sees the monk from below, and the monk also sees the guardian, there is no offense.

比丘、女人在閣下坐，閣上人亦如是。
If a monk and a woman sit below the pavilion, and people above see, the same applies.

或見而非聞、或聞而非見、亦見亦聞、非見非聞。
Seen but not heard, heard but not seen, both seen and heard, neither seen nor heard.

見而非聞者，淨人遙見比丘、女人共坐，不聞語聲，越毗尼罪。
Seen but not heard means the guardian sees the monk and woman sitting together but does not hear their voices, which is a minor transgression.

聞而非見者，聞語聲、不見其人，越毗尼罪。
Heard but not seen means hearing voices but not seeing them, which is a minor transgression.

亦見亦聞者，見共坐、聞語聲，無罪。
Both seen and heard means seeing them sitting together and hearing their voices; there is no offense.

非見非聞者，波夜提。
Neither seen nor heard is an offense of expiation.

盲淨人，越毗尼罪。
A blind guardian is a minor transgression.

聾淨人，越毗尼罪。
A deaf guardian is a minor transgression.

盲聾淨人者，波夜提。
A blind and deaf guardian is an offense of expiation.

一盲、一聾淨人者，無罪。
If there is one blind and one deaf guardian, there is no offense.

若淨人眠者，當動令覺，此罪。
If the guardian is asleep, one should awaken them; if not, it is an offense.

亦是聚落、亦阿練若處、亦是時亦非時、亦是晝亦是夜、是屏處非露處、是空靜非眾多、是近非遠，是故說。
This applies whether it is a village or a forest dwelling, whether it is the right time or not, whether it is day or night, in seclusion or not, in solitude and not in a crowd, near or far. Thus it is said.



故奪及疑悔，
Therefore, we lose and doubt and regret,

不捨藏畏怖，
unable to let go of the hidden fears.




水戏指相拟，  
Water play resembles each other,

共行同室宿，  
Traveling together and sleeping in the same room,




空靜處亦然。
In places of emptiness and tranquility, it is the same.

第七跋渠竟。
The seventh Baqu has been completed.




，廣說如上。  
The Buddha resided in the city of Savatthi, expounding broadly as above.

爾時毘舍佉鹿母，長請祇洹僧次第到其舍，食時毘舍佉鹿母頭面禮僧足。  
At that time, Visakha, known as Deer Mother, often invited monks from Jeta's Grove to her home, and when it was time to eat, she would bow before the monks.

次第而下，到十六群比丘所，見其年少身色柔軟而能捨家。  
Arriving in sequence, she reached the group of sixteen young monks, seeing them youthful, with soft complexions, and capable of renouncing the household life.

女人多慈起兒子想，亦敬法故，即便問言：「祇洹眾僧無供時，尊者何處得食？」  
With the compassion of a mother and respect for the Dharma, she asked, "When there is no offering, where do the monks of Jeta's Grove obtain food?"

答言：「時到著衣持鉢，家家乞食。」  
They replied, "When the time comes, we put on our robes, take our bowls, and seek alms from house to house."

即語尊者：「若無供時，來我家食。我自今已後，若無人供日，我當施食。」  
She then said to the monks, "If there is no offering, come to my home. From now on, on days when no one provides, I will offer food."

年少比丘聞是語已，即便受請，至無供日，到其家食。  
The young monks, hearing these words, accepted the invitation and went to her home to eat on days without offerings.

鹿母長請佛，時尊者阿難日日到彼，為請食故，見十六群比丘在其家食，  
Visakha regularly invited the Buddha, and Venerable Ananda would visit daily for the meals, observing the sixteen monks eating at her home.

此諸年少起憍恣言：「母！此食太多。」  
The young monks, with conceit, said, "Mother! This food is too much."

答言：「子減之。」  
She replied, "Child, take less."

復言：「太少。」  
They then said, "Too little."

答言：「子當益。」  
She replied, "Add more, child."

如是或嫌冷熱、堅軟、甜酢、醎淡，如是種種難可稱適。  
They complained about the food being too hot or cold, hard or soft, sweet or sour, salty or bland, and were difficult to satisfy.

鹿母信心多慈，答言：「子隨索隨與。」  
With faith and kindness, she replied, "Whatever you wish, I will provide."

阿難見已，作是念：「若此是不信家，便起惡心。」  
Ananda, observing this, thought, "If this were a house without faith, negative thoughts would arise."

以是因緣往白佛言：「善哉世尊！願從今日勿與小兒受具足戒。」  
Therefore, he went to the Buddha and said, "World-Honored One, starting today, may we not ordain young ones fully."

佛言：「從今日後年未滿二十，不得與受具足。」  
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, those under twenty years old shall not receive full ordination."



衛城，廣說如上。  
Again, the Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti and explained as above.

爾時摩訶羅父子二人在家，有信捨家修道，其子沙彌供給五百比丘。  
At that time, Mahakara and his son lived at home, had faith, and renounced home to practice the path. His novice son attended five hundred bhikkhus.

諸比丘或索楊枝、或索樹葉，如是眾多不能得供。  
The bhikkhus asked for tooth sticks or leaves but could not be provided with many such items.

時摩訶羅念曰：「我正有一子，供給五百比丘，所索眾多不能得供。  
Then Mahakara thought, "I have only one son, providing for five hundred bhikkhus, and unable to fulfill all their requests.

如是不久，必當生病。然世尊制戒年未滿二十。  
In this way, he will soon become ill. However, the World-Honored One set the rule that one must be at least twenty years old to receive full ordination.

不應與受具戒。雖知不應且與受之，令其免苦。」  
He should not receive full ordination. Although knowing it should not be done, I will still ordain him to relieve his suffering."

即將比丘出到戒場上，與受具足。  
Then he led the bhikkhus to the ordination platform to give them full ordination.

受具足已，諸比丘猶如前法喚言：「沙彌與我知淨楊枝及草樹葉。」  
After receiving full ordination, the bhikkhus still called out as before, "Novice, give me pure tooth sticks and grass leaves."

彼即答言：「我已受具足，云何故喚沙彌？」  
He then replied, "I have received full ordination, why are you still calling me a novice?"

諸比丘言：「誰與汝受？」答言：「我婆樓醯。」  
The bhikkhus asked, "Who gave you ordination?" He replied, "My ordination was given by Mahakara."

諸比丘以是因緣，具白世尊，佛言：「呼摩訶羅來。」  
Due to these circumstances, the bhikkhus reported the matter to the World-Honored One. The Buddha said, "Call Mahakara here."

來已，佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」  
After he came, the Buddha asked him about the matter, "Is this true?" He replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事。摩訶羅！汝云何知人年未滿二十，而與受具足？」  
The Buddha said, "This is a wrong act. Mahakara! How can you ordain someone knowing they are not yet twenty years old?"

佛言：「從今日後，不聽年未滿二十而受具足。」  
The Buddha said, "From this day forward, it is not permitted to ordain anyone not yet twenty years old."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。  
The Buddha addressed the bhikkhus, "Those residing in Shravasti should assemble, and for the benefit of ten purposes, the precept was established for bhikkhus. Those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘知人年不滿二十，與受具足，波夜提。諸比丘應訶責，是人不名受具足。」  
If a bhikkhu knows a person is not yet twenty years old and gives full ordination, it is a pācittiya offense. Bhikkhus should criticize him; such a person is not recognized as fully ordained.


比丘者，如上說。  
Bhikshu, as mentioned above.




知者，若自知、若從他人聞。  
The wise, as if knowing themselves, as if hearing from others.  




不滿者，不滿二十。

雨減二十年，是名不滿二十。
When the rain decreases by twenty years, it is called under twenty.

後安居生還後安居受，未經後安居竟，是名不滿。

此人減二十時，人半謂減、半謂滿。
When this person's age is decreased by twenty, people say half is lesser, half is full.

半謂減者，波夜提。
For those who say it's less, it is a breach of the Vinaya.

謂滿者，無罪，此人名受具足。
For those who say it's enough, it is blameless, and this person is called fully ordained.

此人年減二十時，人一切謂不滿，與受具足，一切波夜提，此人不名受具足。

雨滿二十雨時，人半謂滿、半謂不滿，謂不滿者越毘尼罪，謂滿者無罪，是人名受具足。
When rains are full twenty rains, some people say it's full, some say it's not; those who say not, it's a breach of the Vinaya, those who say full, it's blameless, the person is called fully ordained.

滿二十雨時，人一切謂不滿，一切越毘尼罪，是人不名受具足。
When it rains for full twenty, everyone says it’s insufficient, all commit a breach of the Vinaya, the person is not called fully ordained.

滿二十雨，一切謂滿，一切無罪，是人善受具足。
When it rains for full twenty, everyone says it’s sufficient, all are blameless, the person is well-ordained.

若比丘知人不滿二十，與受具足，此諸比丘應呵責已，波夜提悔過。
If a bhikkhu knows a person is under twenty and gives full ordination, such bhikkhus should be reproached and confess a breach of the Vinaya.



波夜提者，如上說。

A poṣadha, as previously mentioned.




受具足，月滿者應與受具足，不滿者應語令待滿。
If someone comes seeking ordination, it should be given to those who are of full age while those not of age should be told to wait.

若前人不知者，當問其父母親里。
If previous people don't know, they should ask their parents or close relatives.

若復不知，當看生年板。
If still not known, they should check the birth record.

若復無是者，當觀其顏狀，觀時不得直觀形體，或貴樂家子形大年少。
If there is still no evidence, they should observe their appearance, but not directly judge their physique, as one's stature might be large while young in wealthy families.

當觀其手足成就不？
They should observe whether their hands and feet are fully developed.

若如是復不知者，當問何王？何歲？國土豐儉、旱澇時節。
If it's still unknown, they should inquire about the king, year, and whether the land was prosperous or experiencing drought or flooding.

是故說。
Thus it is said.




佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in Śrāvastī and explained in detail as above.

爾時舍衛、毘舍離二國有嫌，年年互相抄伐。
At that time, there was animosity between the countries of Śrāvastī and Vaiśālī, and they attacked each other annually.

時毘舍離人來舍衛抄劫人民，得物去，還入本界生安隱想，解仗止息。
When people from Vaiśālī came to Śrāvastī to plunder, they took what they could, returned to their domain, felt at peace, and put down their weapons to rest.

舍衛王作是念：「我為國王，應却隣敵安民，云何使賊劫掠人物？」
The king of Śrāvastī thought, "As a king, I should repel neighbors and secure the people. Why should I allow bandits to plunder and seize people and goods?"

即勅將士：「仰汝追捕必使擒獲，若不得者不足空還。」
He ordered his soldiers, "You are commanded to pursue and capture them, and do not return empty-handed."

將士念言：「王教嚴重，事應宜速。」即集兵眾尋蹤掩襲。
The soldiers thought, "The king's orders are strict, and we should act quickly." They gathered troops to track and ambush.

時舍衛比丘安居竟，欲詣毘舍離，諸比丘失道，墮彼賊中。
When the monks of Śrāvastī finished their retreat, they wanted to go to Vaiśālī, but they lost their way and ended up among the bandits.

賊便驚愕，問比丘：「比丘！汝是何人？」
The bandits were surprised and asked the monks, "Monks, who are you?"

答言：「我出家人。」
They replied, "We are ascetics."

「何道出家？」
"What path have you taken to become ascetics?"

答言：「釋種出家。」
They answered, "We follow the path of the Shakya lineage."

問言：「大德！汝欲那去？」
The bandits asked, "Venerable ones, where do you want to go?"

答言：「欲向毘舍離，失道到此。」
They replied, "We want to go to Vaiśālī, but we have lost our way and ended up here."

即示其道。
The bandits then showed them the way.

時比丘問賊：「長壽！汝欲何去？」
At that time, a monk asked the bandits, "Good sir, where do you want to go?"

答言：「向毘舍離。」
They answered, "To Vaiśālī."

比丘復言：「當共作伴。」
The monk said again, "Let's accompany each other."

彼即答言：「我等是賊，劫奪他物，徑涉榛木行不擇路。」
The bandit responded, "We are robbers, taking others' belongings, wandering through thickets without choosing paths."

汝是善人，云何隨我？此是直道，可從是去。」
"You are good people, why would you follow us? This is a straight path, you can take it."

比丘復請：「願將我去！勿復令我重遭失道。」
The monk again pleaded, "Please take me! Don't let me lose my way again."

賊答如初，如是至三，語言未竟追捕尋至，合捉比丘，將至王所，作如是言：「大王！此是群賊。」
The bandits replied as before, and thrice this happened; before finishing their words, they were pursued and captured with the monks and brought to the king, saying, "Great King, these are bandits."

王言：「先將比丘來。」
The king said, "Bring the monks here first."

來已，王言：「汝出家人，云何作賊？」
When they came, the king said, "You are ascetics; how have you become bandits?"

比丘答言：「我非是賊。」
The monks replied, "We are not bandits."

「何故相隨。」
"Why then are you together?"

比丘以上事具向王說。
The monks told the king the whole story.

王言：「遣比丘去。將此賊來。」
The king said, "Release the monks. Bring the bandits here."

來已，問賊言：「此出家人是汝伴不？」
When they came, he asked the bandits, "Are these ascetics your companions?"

答言：「非伴。」
They replied, "They are not companions."

「何故相隨？」
"Why then are you together?"

賊以上事具向王說。
The bandits told the king the whole story.

王言：「將賊去。更喚比丘來。」
The king said, "Take the bandits away. Call the monks back."

來已，王問比丘：「汝出家人，云何作賊？妄語欺官，望得脫耶？賊道汝是伴，何以言非？」
When they came, the king asked the monks, "You are ascetics; how have you become bandits? Are you lying to officials, hoping to escape? The bandits said you are companions; why do you deny it?"

比丘答如初。
The monks answered as before.

王即教勅禁官放比丘去，賊如法治罪。
The king then instructed the penal officers to release the monks, and punish the bandits according to the law.

便取五百群賊，著迦毘羅華鬘，打鼓搖鈴四交道頭，唱喚而出，欲將殺之，賊大啼哭。
Five hundred bandits were captured, adorned with garlands of Kāpilā flowers, and taken to the crossroads with drums and bells ringing, ready to be executed. The bandits cried loudly.

佛知而故問：「比丘！是何等眾多人聲？」
The Buddha, knowing this, deliberately asked, "Monks, what is this sound of many people?"

比丘答言：「世尊！是五百群賊，被王教令將欲殺之。是其聲耳。」
The monks replied, "World Honored One, it is the sound of five hundred bandits whom the king is about to execute."

佛告阿難：「汝往語王：『汝是人王，當慈民如子，云何一時殺五百人？』」
The Buddha instructed Ananda, "Go tell the king, 'You are a king, you should be compassionate to your people like children; how can you kill five hundred people at once?'"

阿難受教，即詣王所，具說佛語。
Ananda accepted the instruction and went to the king to convey the Buddha's words.

王言：「尊者阿難！我知是事，若殺一人罪報甚多，況復五百人。」
The king said, "Venerable Ananda, I know this matter; if one person is killed, the karmic retribution is severe, let alone five hundred."

但是賊數數來壞我聚落、抄掠人民，若世尊能使是人不復作賊者，可放令活。」
These bandits repeatedly harm our settlements and plunder the people. If the World Honored One can make them not commit banditry again, they can be spared."

阿難即還，以王所說具白佛。
Ananda then returned and reported what the king had said to the Buddha.

佛語阿難：「更往語王：『王但放去，我能令此人從今日後更不作賊。』」
The Buddha told Ananda, "Go again and tell the king, 'Just release them; I can ensure they will not commit banditry from today onward.'"

阿難受教已，先到刑處，語監殺者言：「是諸罪人世尊已救，未可便殺。」
Ananda, having received the instruction, first went to the place of execution and told the executioners, "These criminals have been saved by the World Honored One and should not be killed immediately."

復語賊言：「汝能出家不？」
He further asked the bandits, "Can you become ascetics?"

賊言：「尊者！我本若出家不遭此苦，今甚願樂，何由可得？」
The bandits replied, "Venerable sir, if we had become ascetics earlier, we would not have faced such suffering. Now we greatly desire it, but how can we achieve it?"

阿難即至王所，作是言：「世尊語王：『我能令此人從今日後更不作賊。』」
Ananda then went to the king and said, "The World Honored One says to the king, 'I can ensure these people will not be bandits from today onward.'"

王即勅監官：「可原生命，且未解縛，送詣世尊，佛自放之。」
The king instructed the officials, "Pardon their lives for now without untying them and escort them to the World Honored One; the Buddha will release them himself."

爾時世尊欲度彼人故，在露地坐，賊遙見佛繫縛自解，頭面禮足，却住一面。
At that time, the World Honored One, wanting to save them, sat in an open field. The bandits saw the Buddha from afar, untied themselves, bowed in respect, and stood aside.

佛觀其宿緣隨順說法，布施持戒行業報應，苦習盡道四真諦法，即於是時得須陀洹道。
The Buddha observed their karmic ties and preached according to them: charity, morality, deeds, retribution, and the Four Noble Truths. At that time, they attained the path of Stream-entry.

問言：「汝等樂出家不？」
The Buddha asked, "Do you wish to become ascetics?"

答言：「世尊！我等先若出家不遭此苦，唯願今者度我出家。」
They replied, "World Honored One, if we had become ascetics earlier, we would not have faced such suffering. We sincerely wish to become ascetics now."

佛言：「善來比丘！」作是語時，五百群賊舉身被服變為三衣，自然鉢器、威儀庠序，如似百歲舊比丘，皆成羅漢。
The Buddha said, "Come, monks!" As he spoke, the five hundred bandits were clothed in three robes, naturally possessed alms bowls, and their demeanor matched that of old monks of a hundred years, all becoming Arhats.

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！云何五百群賊蒙世尊恩自然解脫？」
The monks said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, how did these five hundred bandits receive your grace and attain liberation naturally?"

佛言：「不但今日蒙我解脫，過去世時已曾蒙我，如《獼猴本生經》中廣說。」
The Buddha replied, "Not only today have they received my liberation, but also in past lives, as explained in detail in the 'Jataka of the Monkey.'"

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。”
The Buddha told the monks, "All who reside in Śrāvastī should gather; for ten benefits, I will establish precepts for the monks, even for those who have heard them before should hear them again."

若比丘與賊期共道行，乃至聚落間，波夜提。」
If a monk makes an agreement to travel with bandits, even between villages, it is a Pācittiya offense."



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as mentioned above.




賊者，劫盜。
A thief is a robber.




“今未供”，其言未必不可。

"Today", "tomorrow", "one month", "half a month".

臣区区守职，不能以仆效。 

"I have yet to receive anything," means it may not be impossible.

但请勉为，以遂其志。

I diligently uphold my duty, unable to serve. 

此殆之言之甚也。

But please strive to fulfill their ambitions.

此之字也，虽则吾无能能，然则吾未必不可。

This is the gravest of words.




道者，三由延、二由延、一由延、一拘盧舍、半拘盧舍，乃至聚落，波夜提。
The path can be three yojanas, two yojanas, one yojana, one krosha, half a krosha, up to a village's distance, as laid down in the Vinaya.




波夜提者，如上說。  
Prajñaptir, as explained above.  




期道行，若比丘欲行時，當求車伴、人伴。
One should not travel with thieves; if a monk wishes to travel, they should seek companions with vehicles or people.

賊相貌有三事可知：香、色、莊嚴。香者，在曠野中食熟肉生肉。
There are three features to recognize a thief: scent, appearance, and demeanor. Scent refers to eating cooked or raw meat in the wilderness.

氣色者，常恐怖色。莊嚴者，終日結束，面黑、髮黃，兇惡似閻羅人，
Appearance refers to always having a frightening expression. Demeanor means being menacing all day, with a dark face and yellow hair, resembling a demon.

是三種名為賊相，不應共行。
These three characteristics are called thief signs and one should not travel with them.

若賊詐稱作好人，著好衣服，到空逈處，展轉相語：
If a thief pretends to be a good person and wears nice clothes, and when in a secluded place, they speak among themselves:

「今日當入是聚落，破壞牆壁、劫奪財物，不問沙門婆羅門，一切盡取。」
"Today we shall enter this settlement, destroy walls, rob valuables, not minding anyone, and take everything."

當知是賊，是時不得即便捨離，且隨順去。
One should recognize them as thieves and not immediately abandon them, but comply with them for the time being.

若近聚落，方便捨去。
If near a settlement, discreetly leave them.

若賊覺者，應語：「長壽！我正到此耳。」
If the thieves notice, one should say, "I have merely arrived here by chance."

若與賊共期道行，波夜提。
If one travels with thieves, it is an offense.

與女賊共行亦如是。
The same applies to traveling with women thieves.

與偷金賊共行，波夜提。
Traveling with gold-thieves is also an offense.

與叛負債人共行，越毘尼罪。
Traveling with people who default on debts is a violation.

是故說。
For this reason, it is said


舍，廣說如上。
The Buddha stayed in a wilderness monastery and spoke extensively as described above.

爾時營事比丘，自掘地作基作塼作泥，為世人所譏：
At that time, a managing monk dug the ground to make foundations, bricks, and mud, and was criticized by the people:

「沙門瞿曇無量方便，毀呰殺生、讚歎不殺，而今自手掘地作基作塼作泥，故傷破根命。
"The ascetic Gautama extensively opposes killing and praises non-killing, but now digs the ground by hand to make foundations, bricks, and mud, thereby harming living roots.

此是敗人，何道之有？」
This is a ruinous act, where is the path in this?"

諸比丘以是因緣，往白世尊，
The monks, due to this reason, went to inform the Blessed One,

佛言：「呼營事比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the managing monk to come here."

來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」
Once he arrived, the Buddha asked the monk, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
He replied, "It is true."

佛語比丘：「此中雖無命根，出家之人所不應作，
The Buddha said to the monk, "Although there is no living root here, it is something a renunciant should not do,

當少事少務，莫為世人所譏，失他善福。
You should have few tasks and few duties, and not be criticized by people, losing their good merits.

從今日後不得自手掘地。」
From this day onward, you should not dig the ground by hand."

佛告諸比丘：「依止曠野諸比丘皆悉令集，
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all the monks residing in the wilderness,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
For ten benefits, I impose a precept on the monks, even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘自手掘地、若使人掘、指示語掘，波夜提。」
