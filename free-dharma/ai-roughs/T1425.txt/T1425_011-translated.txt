我曾经漫步在无尽的沙漠

I once wandered in the endless desert

阳光燃烧着我的心头

The sunlight burned my heart

风暴卷起尘土，遮住我的视线

The storm whipped up dust, blocking my vision

我寻找着那遥远的绿洲

I searched for that distant oasis

终于在昨日的黄昏

Finally, at yesterday's dusk

我看到了希望的曙光

I saw the dawn of hope

抬起头，微笑着迎接

I lifted my head, smiling to welcome

新一天的到来

The arrival of a new day




東晉天竺三藏佛陀跋陀羅共法顯譯
Translated by Buddhabhadra and Faxian, the three Tripitaka masters from the Eastern Jin dynasty in India




諸佛弟子捉劍杖刀劒等向人欲恐怖者波夜提提舍。

If a disciple of the Buddhas brandishes a stick, knife, or sword at someone intending to frighten them, this is a pācittiya offense.

若見有因緣非人故向者得越。

However, if there is a reason and it is not to frighten people, then it is not an offense.

心疑者，舉捨。

If in doubt, the mind should be cleared.

心不疑者，得越。

If not in doubt, there is no offense.




佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Buddha resided in Śrāvastī and explained extensively as above.

爾時長老難陀、優波難陀冬盛寒時，著厚納衣，敷煖床褥，頭上著帽、脚著富羅，前然爐火。
At that time, during the height of winter, Elder Nanda and Upananda wore thick padded clothes, spread warm bedding, wore hats on their heads, put on socks, and had a fire ablaze in front of them.

有二外道，黑色碧眼寒顫而來，在前立住，外道見已心生樂著，即語比丘言：「汝等出家得如是樂。」
Two non-believers of dark complexion and blue eyes, shivering from the cold, came and stood before them. Seeing this, the outsider's heart delighted and said to the bhikkhus, "You have obtained such joy from renunciation."

時外道心樂佛法，便作是言：「我等亦名出家，而值弗蘭迦葉教，我等裸形拔髮投巖赴㵎，五熱炙身而行乞食，徒受辛苦而無樂事。」
Then the outsider, joyful in the Buddha's teachings, said, "We also claim renunciation, but adhere to the teaching of Plankāśyapa, we go naked, pluck our hair, throw ourselves onto rocks, burn ourselves with five fires, and beg for food, enduring suffering without joy."

比丘報言：「汝若樂此法者，便來出家，亦復如我得是樂住。」
The bhikkhu replied, "If you enjoy this practice, then come renounce, and you too can dwell in such joy as I do."

外道答言：「我無沙門僧伽梨。」
The outsider answered, "I have no saṅghāti robe."

比丘報言：「但來，我當與汝。」
The bhikkhu replied, "Just come, I will give it to you."

外道即來，便與出家受具足已，語言：「我今度汝出家受具足，汝當作如是給事，我晨當早起問訊安眠不？
The outsider came, accepted ordination, and was fully ordained. He then said, "I have now ordained you and you have received full ordination, you should serve like this: in the morning, get up early and ask if I had a restful night.

出唾壺器及小便器著常處；淨洗手，授澡水齒木，持鉢迎粥，小食已洗鉢令燥，安著常處；
Take out the spittoon and urinal and place them in the usual spot; wash your hands clean, provide water for washing and teeth-cleaning sticks, hold the bowl to receive porridge, after eating wash the bowl and let it dry, and place it in the usual spot;

若有請處，當迎食；
If there is an invitation, you should go accept the meal;

我欲入聚落時，當持入聚落衣授我；取我常著衣，料理卷疊安著常處。
When I want to enter the village, you should bring the village-entry robe and give it to me; take my usual robe, fold it, and place it in the usual spot.

我從聚落還時，汝當敷小床座，與我水并授樹葉食時，
When I return from the village, you should prepare a small bed and seat, provide me water and give me leaves to eat with,

以扇扇食已洗鉢令乾，舉著常處。
Fan the bowl after washing to make it dry, then place it in the usual place.

脫入聚落衣卷舉，復授我常所著衣。
Fold and take off the village-entry robe, then give me my usual robe again.

汝食已，當取薪草浣衣煮染，淨掃房內，巨磨塗地。
After you eat, take firewood to wash, cook and dye the robes, clean the room, and polish the floor with a large grindstone.

我欲入林坐禪時，汝當持坐具隨後，還時隨還，當與我水洗手。
When I want to enter the forest for meditation, you carry the mat and follow, and when returning, follow back, and provide me water to wash my hands.

授香花供養訖，當敷床與我洗足水。
After offering incense and flowers, prepare a bed and provide me water to wash my feet.

復以油摩敷置臥具，內唾壺及小便器然燈，如是種種供給。
Then apply oil on the bedding, place the spittoon and urinal inside, and light the lamp, providing such various services.

安隱我已，然後自事。」
Once I am settled, then attend to your own matters."

時彼比丘答師言：「此非出家法，便是婢作。」
At that time, the bhikkhu answered the teacher, "This is not the practice of renunciation; this is the work of a servant."

師言：「汝若不能作者，當還我僧伽梨。」
The teacher said, "If you cannot do this, then return my saṅghāti robe."

彼即脫衣著地而去。
He immediately took off the robe, placed it on the ground, and left.



復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Again, Buddha resided in Śrāvastī and preached extensively as above.

爾時尊者難陀，是優波難陀兄。
At that time, the Venerable Nanda was the elder brother of Upananda.

時優波難陀語兄共行弟子言：「我共汝入聚落，當與汝物。
Then Upananda said to his fellow disciple, "Let's go to the village together, and I will give you things.

我若作非威儀事，汝勿語他人，我是汝叔父。」
If I do something improper, do not tell others. I am your uncle."

答言：「若我見父作非法，亦當向人說，況復叔父優波難陀。」
He replied, "If I see my father doing something wrong, I would tell others, much less my uncle Upananda."

復言：「若汝如此，當使汝知。」
Upananda said, "If you do this, I will let you know."

即將至貴家檀越留食，欲不與彼食，
He took him to a wealthy patron's house to have a meal, intending not to share the food.

故作是思惟：「相望日時，使此不得乞食，還復失時。」
He thought, "If the sun reaches noon and he cannot beg for food, he will miss the time."

即便告言：「汝還精舍。」
He then said, "You return to the monastery."

即便還，畏失時故，疾疾看日而行。
He immediately returned, afraid of losing time, and hurriedly glanced at the sun while walking.

至精舍，見諸比丘皆悉食已，
Upon arriving at the monastery, he saw that all the monks had already eaten.

門前經行，遙見疾行疑必有以，
Walking in the courtyard, he saw him hurrying in the distance and suspected he had a reason.

即問汝：「今日共多知識比丘處處教化，得何等好食脣膩如是？」
He asked, "Today, where did you preach with many learned monks to get such fine food, making your lips so oily?"

答言：「我今失食，況得好者。」
He replied, "I missed my meal today, let alone had good food."

優波難陀遣彼還已，於後食種種飲食。
After sending him back, Upananda ate various foods later.

食已恐事情露，疾還。
After eating, fearing exposure, he hastily returned.

見諸比丘叢聚而論，便作是思惟：
Seeing the monks gathering and discussing, he thought:

「眾人集論，必彼比丘向諸梵行人說我過惡。」
"They must be talking about my wrongdoings to other practitioners."

即語難陀言：「長老！汝弟子向諸梵行人說我過惡。」
He immediately said to Nanda, "Elder! Your disciple is speaking ill of me to other practitioners."

彼即瞋恚語弟子言：「汝今云何說我弟過？汝可還我僧伽梨來。」
He angrily said to the disciple, "How dare you speak of my brother's faults? Return my robe."

諸比丘聞已，共相謂言：「此比丘今日遭二苦惱：一者失食，二者失衣。」
When the monks heard this, they said among themselves, "This monk suffered two hardships today: he missed his meal and lost his robe."

佛聞是已，知而故問諸比丘：「此何比丘高聲大語？」
Buddha heard this and, knowing, asked the monks, "Which monk is speaking loudly?"

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！此難陀奪共行弟子衣，是故大聲。」
The monks replied to Buddha, "World Honored One! It is Nanda who took the fellow disciple's robe, which is why he is shouting."

佛言：「呼難陀來。」
The Buddha said, "Call Nanda here."

來已佛廣問難陀：
Once he came, Buddha questioned Nanda thoroughly:

「汝實為自供給故，度人與衣，令弟子瞋，不能作婢作，乃至奪共行弟子衣耶？」
"Did you, in truth, ordain a person for self-benefit, give him a robe, cause him to get angry, unable to act as a servant, and even take the fellow disciple's robe?"

答言：「實爾。」
He answered, "Indeed."

佛語難陀：「汝云何度人出家，不教法律，但令執作供給自己？」
Buddha said to Nanda, "How can you ordain someone without teaching them the Dharma, only making them serve you?"

佛種種因緣呵已，告諸比丘：
Buddha reproached him for various reasons and told the monks:

「從今日不得立心為供給自己故度人出家，度者，得越毘尼罪。
"From today, you must not ordain anyone with the intent of having them serve you; such an act incurs a Vinaya offense.

應作如是念：『當使彼人因我度故，修諸善法得成道果。』
One should contemplate thus: 'Because of my ordaining him, he should cultivate good Dharmas and attain the fruits of the path.'

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者盡集，
Buddha told the monks, "All residing near Śrāvastī should gather,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
for ten benefits, instruct the monks to uphold the precepts, even those who have heard it before should hear it again.

若比丘與比丘衣後瞋恚不喜，若自奪、若使人奪，
If a monk, after giving a robe, becomes angry and displeased, either taking it back himself or having another take it,

作是言：『比丘！還我衣來，不與汝。』
and says, 'Monk! Return my robe, I won't give it to you.'

得者，尼薩耆波夜提。」
This constitutes a Niḥsargika Pācittika offense."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as explained above.




衣者，七種，如上說。
Clothing comes in seven kinds, as mentioned above.




瞋恚不喜者，九惱，如上說。
For those who are angry and unhappy, there are nine troubles, as mentioned above.




奪者，若自奪、若使人奪，作如是言：「還我衣來，不與汝。」
If someone takes it, whether they take it themselves or have someone else take it, saying, "Give me back my clothes, I won't give them to you."

得者，尼薩耆波夜提。
The offender incurs a Nissaggiya Pacittiya.




尼薩耆波夜提者，如上說。
Nisagghiyapayajit refers to, as mentioned above.




奪、或使人與自奪、或自與自奪、或使與使奪、合與別奪、別與合奪、合與合奪、別與別奪。
Either self gives and others seize, or others give and self seizes, or self gives and self seizes, or others give and others seize, combined giving with separate seizing, separate giving with combined seizing, combined giving with combined seizing, separate giving with separate seizing.

合與別奪者，比丘一時與三衣已，別奪言：「還我僧伽梨、還我欝多羅僧、還我安陀會。」
In the case of combined giving with separate seizing, the monk gives three robes at one time, and separately seizes saying, "Return my sanghati, return my uttarasanga, return my antaravasa."

如是奪者，得眾多波夜提。是名合與別奪。
Seizing in this way, one obtains numerous offenses. This is called combined giving with separate seizing.

別與合奪者，比丘非一時與僧伽梨、與欝多羅僧、與安陀會，還一時盡奪：「汝還我衣來。」
In separate giving with combined seizing, the monk does not give the sanghati, uttarasanga, and antaravasa at one time, but later seizes them all at once saying, "Return my robes to me."

如是奪者，得一波夜提罪，是名別與合奪。
Seizing in this way, one incurs one offense. This is called separate giving with combined seizing.

合與合奪者，比丘一時與衣，後言：「盡還我衣來。」
In combined giving with combined seizing, the monk gives the robe at one time and later says, "Return all my robes."

如是奪者，得一波夜提。
Seizing in this way, one incurs one offense.

別與別奪者，比丘非一時與僧伽梨、與欝多羅僧、與安陀會，比丘漸奪：「還我僧伽梨、還我欝多羅僧、還我安陀會。」
In separate giving with separate seizing, the monk does not give the sanghati, uttarasanga, and antaravasa at one time, but gradually seizes, saying, "Return my sanghati, return my uttarasanga, return my antaravasa."

如是索，得者，眾多波夜提。
Requesting in this way and obtaining, one incurs numerous offenses.

若比丘與比丘衣時，作是言：「汝住我邊者，當與汝衣。」若不住者，奪，無罪。
If when a monk gives a robe to another monk, he says, "If you stay by my side, the robe is yours." If the condition is not met and he takes it back, there is no offense.

若比丘與比丘衣時，作是言：「汝此處住者，當與。」若不住者，奪，無罪。
If when a monk gives a robe to another monk, he says, "If you stay at this place, it is yours." If the condition is not met and he takes it back, there is no offense.

若比丘與比丘衣，汝適我意者與，不適意還奪，無罪。
If a monk gives a robe to another monk pleasing to him, but it is not fitting and he takes it back, there is no offense.

為受經者與，不受經者還奪，無罪。
If given for one who studies the scriptures, but he does not, and it is taken back, there is no offense.

若比丘賣衣未取直，若錢直未畢，若還取衣者，無罪。
If a monk sells a robe but has not yet received the price, or the money is not complete, and he takes back the robe, there is no offense.

若比丘與共行弟子、依止弟子衣已，不可教誡，為折伏故奪，後折伏已還與，無罪。
If a monk gives a robe to a co-practicing or dependent disciple who cannot be instructed, and takes it back for the purpose of discipline, then returns it after discipline, there is no offense.


奪比丘衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。
Taking a monk's robe results in a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.

奪比丘尼衣者，偷蘭罪。
Taking a nun's robe results in a thullaccaya offense.

奪式叉摩尼、沙彌、沙彌尼衣者，越毘尼罪。
Taking a sikkhamana, samanera, or samaneri's robe results in a minor offense.

乃至奪俗人衣者，越毘尼心悔，是故說。
Even taking a layperson's clothing requires remorse for a minor offense, thus it is said.




佛住舍衛城，四方各十二由旬內施僧雨浴衣，如《毘舍佉鹿母因緣》廣說。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, and within a radius of twelve yojanas provided rain bathing robes to the monks, as elaborated in the story of "Visakha's Deer Mother Cause."

復次佛住憍薩羅國遊行時，有一摩訶羅比丘，下著雨衣上著安陀會，捉長柄掃篲掃地。
Again, while the Buddha was traveling in the Kosala country, there was a monk named Mahala who was wearing a rain robe on the bottom and an outer robe on top, sweeping the ground with a long-handled broom.

佛見已語諸比丘：「汝見是摩訶羅不？云何顛倒著衣？」
The Buddha saw this and said to the monks, "Do you see Mahala? Why is he wearing his robes in reverse order?"

是摩訶羅見佛已，往到佛所，頭面禮足却住一面。
Mahala, having seen the Buddha, went to where the Buddha was, bowed with his head at the feet, and then stood to one side.

佛知而故問：「摩訶羅，汝下著何衣？」
The Buddha knowingly asked, "Mahala, what robe are you wearing on the bottom?"

答言：「雨衣。」
He replied, "The rain robe."

「上著何衣？」答言：「安陀會。」
"What are you wearing on top?" He replied, "The outer robe."

佛言：「比丘！汝云何應在上衣而反在下，下衣在上？汝今云何一切時受用雨衣？」
The Buddha said, "Monk! Why are you wearing the upper robe on the bottom and the lower robe on top? How is it that you use the rain robe at all times?"

佛語諸比丘：「汝等待如來從憍薩羅國遊行還舍衛城時，汝當語我：『當為諸比丘制雨浴衣。』」
The Buddha told the monks, "Wait until the Tathagata returns to the city of Shravasti from the Kosala country, then remind me, 'We should stipulate rain bathing robes for the monks.'"

佛憍薩羅國遊行還已，諸比丘白佛言：「世尊在憍薩羅國遊行時，作是言：『如來從憍薩羅國遊行還舍衛時，汝便語我：「當為諸比丘制雨浴衣。」』今正是時，願制雨衣。」
When the Buddha returned from traveling in Kosala, the monks said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, while traveling in Kosala you said, 'When the Tathagata returns to Shravasti, remind me to stipulate rain bathing robes for the monks.' Now is the time to do so."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者盡集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all those residing in Shravasti; for the benefit of ten reasons, I shall establish rules for the monks, even those who have already heard should listen again.

若比丘春殘一月在，比丘當求雨衣，半月當作成受用。
If a monk resides for one month at the end of spring, the monk should acquire a rain robe and use it for half a month.

若比丘未至春殘一月求雨衣，半月作成受用者，尼薩耆波夜提。」
If a monk, not having stayed for one month at the end of spring, acquires a rain robe and uses it for half a month, it is a Nisaghiya Pacittiya offense.



春残一月者，三月后十五日、四月初十五日，是名春残一月。
The remaining month of spring: the fifteenth day after the third month, the fifteenth day of early April, this is called the remaining month of spring.




雨衣者，如世尊所聽。  
A raincoat is as the Blessed One has heard.




衣者，有十種，如上說。
For clothing, there are ten types, as mentioned above.




求者，乞索勸化。
The seeker, beg for inspiration.

求時不應從小家處處求一尺二尺，
When seeking, do not ask for a foot or two from small families everywhere,

應從殷有大家中求，
You should seek from the wealthy and prominent households,

若一人邊、若眾多人邊得，是名求。
Whether from an individual or from many people, this is called seeking.




殘半月者，從三月十六日，應作浣染縫，至四月一日應受用。
For half a month, starting from March 16th, one should engage in washing, dyeing, and sewing, and be ready to use by April 1st.

若比丘未至求者，未至三月十六日前求，作成受用者，尼薩耆波夜提。
If a monk has not yet arrived to make a request, and requests before March 16th for something already prepared for use, it is a transgression called Nisagghiya Pacittiya.




尼薩耆波夜提者，如上說。
Nisagya-pacittiya, as stated above.




比丘有五法成就僧應羯磨，作分雨衣人。
There are five achievements a monk must have for the sangha to carry out the karma, making him the one responsible for distributing rain robes.

何等五？
What are these five?

不隨愛、不隨瞋、不隨怖、不隨癡、得不得知，是名五。
Free from desire, hatred, fear, and ignorance, and understanding whether there is gain or not, these are the five.

羯磨人應作是說：「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，若僧時到，僧拜某甲比丘作分雨衣人，白如是。」
The karma practitioner should say this: "Venerable Sangha, listen! Monk so-and-so has achieved the five laws, if the time for the sangha is right, let the sangha appoint monk so-and-so as the distributor of rain robes, thus I propose."

「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，僧今拜某甲比丘作分雨衣人。
"Venerable Sangha, listen! Monk so-and-so has achieved the five laws, now the sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the distributor of rain robes.

諸大德忍某甲比丘作分雨衣人，忍者僧默然，若不忍便說。」
May the venerable ones allow monk so-and-so to be the distributor of rain robes. If you consent, remain silent. If not, please speak."

「僧已忍，拜某甲比丘作分雨衣人竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
"The sangha has consented, and monk so-and-so is appointed as the distributor of rain robes, the sangha's consent being shown by their silence, thus this matter is settled."

作羯磨已，應眾中唱言：「大德僧聽！若衣有大小，降四指、八指不等不計者，我當分。」
After completing the karma, it should be announced in the assembly: "Venerable Sangha, listen! If the robes vary in size, either four fingers' width, eight fingers' width, or uneven, I shall distribute them."

若不唱者，得越毘尼罪。
If not announced, it results in a transgression of Vinaya.

此人作羯磨已，當為僧求，
After this person completes the karma, he should seek for the sangha,

求時不應從小家處處求一尺二尺，
When seeking, he should not request a foot or two from small households,

應從殷有大家中，若一人邊得、若眾多人邊得，
He should seek from wealthy large households, either from one person or many people,

下至得一雨衣是名求。
At least obtaining one rain robe is called seeking.

若三月十六日已後送衣來者，應分。
If robes are sent after the sixteenth day of the third month, they should be distributed.

應語僧上座言：「為欲今取、為欲待後？後或有勝者。」
He should ask the senior monks: "Do you want to receive it now, or wait for later? Later, there might be a better one."

上座若言：「今取。」便與。
If a senior monk says: "Take it now," then give it.

若言：「後取。」待後應與。
If he says: "Take it later," then wait and give it later.

若有客比丘者，應問：「汝欲何處夏安居？」
If there is a visiting monk, he should be asked: "Where do you plan to spend the summer residence?"

若言：「此處。」應與。
If he says: "Here," then he should be given.

若言：「我欲餘處安居，欲此處取雨衣。」者，亦應與。
If he says: "I wish to reside elsewhere but want a rain robe from here," he should also be given.

語言：「汝於餘處更莫取。」
Tell him: "You should not take more from elsewhere."

若言：「我不此間取，待安居處當取。」隨其意。
If he says: "I won't take it here, I'll wait till I arrive at the residence," then follow his wish.

若多得雨衣者，一人應與兩，沙彌，應與一。
If many rain robes are obtained, one person should be given two, a novice, one.

若少不周接者，安居訖分衣時，應偏與雨衣直，
If the number is insufficient, and at the end of residence when robes are distributed, they should be distributed evenly along with rain robes,

此衣不得受，當三衣不得作淨施。
These robes should not be accepted, and three robes should not be given as a clean offering.

不得著雨衣入河中池中浴，不得小小雨時著。
Rain robes should not be worn when bathing in rivers or ponds or in light rain.

浴亦不得裸身，浴當著舍勒。
When bathing, one should not be naked and must wear a sarong.

若餘故衣，不得著雨衣種種作事，當須大雨時被浴。
If there are other old robes, they should not be used for various tasks with rain robes, and should be worn when bathing during heavy rain.

若雨卒止，垢液者，得著入餘水中浴，無罪。
If the rain suddenly stops, and impurities flow, one may enter other water to bathe, without wrongdoing.

若比丘食時，欲以油塗身；若病時，若多人行處，得繫兩頭作障。
If a monk, at mealtime, wishes to apply oil to the body; during illness or in crowded places, he may tie both ends as a barrier.



此雨浴衣得四月半受用，至八月十五日應當捨。
This rain robe is to be used from mid-April and should be given up by the 15th of August.

捨法者，一比丘應眾中作是唱：「大德僧聽！今日僧捨雨浴衣。」
The method of giving up is as follows: A monk should declare among the assembly, "Great virtuous monks, listen! Today the monks give up the rain robe."

如是三說。若至十六日捨者，得越毘尼罪。
He should say this three times. If the robe is given up after the 16th day, it is an offense of transgression.

捨已，得用作三衣，亦得知識比丘邊作淨，亦得入餘水中浴，種種著作，無罪。
Once given up, it can be used as part of the three robes, purified by a knowledgeable monk, and used for bathing in other waters. Various actions involving it are not offenses.

是故說。
Thus it is spoken.



，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in Shravasti and elaborating as above.

爾時尊者難陀、優波難陀持縷入居士家，語優婆夷言：「施我縷。」
At that time, Venerable Nanda and Upananda took threads into a layperson's house and said to a female devotee, "Give me threads."

諸居士婦女作是念：「此比丘欲買縷。」
The laywomen thought, "These monks want to buy threads."

各持縷出。
Each brought out threads.

比丘見已，即取比己縷而作是言：「我正欲求此縷比，今得相似。」
The monks, seeing them, took threads matching those they had and said, "I was just looking for something like this; now I have found it."

若見好者，便作是言：「我欲求此比而更得勝者。」
If they saw a good thread, they would say, "I want something like this, but of better quality."

若見麁者便作是言：「此縷雖麁可作好者。」
If they saw a coarse thread, they would say, "Although this thread is coarse, it can be made into something good."

因如是齎縷來者，都無得脫。
As a result, those who brought threads could not leave without giving them away.

重擔而來，去祇洹精舍不遠有一窮巷，在中起織坊，度織師出家，使織衣。
They came with heavy loads and set up a weaving workshop in a remote lane near the Jetavana monastery, ordaining weavers to make robes.

尊者阿難到時，著入聚落衣，持鉢次行乞食，到其門前。
When Venerable Ananda arrived, dressed in village robes and carrying a bowl, he approached their door while on alms round.

見難陀、優波難陀，捉線丸共張㲲經，見已共相問訊，阿難問言：「長老作何等？」
He saw Nanda and Upananda holding spools of thread, stretching fabric, and after exchanging greetings asked, "Elder, what are you doing?"

答言：「欲織衣。」
They replied, "We want to weave robes."

彼即念言：「我今日見侍者阿難，必語世尊，當作方便。」
They thought, "Having seen Ananda today, he will surely report this to the Blessed One, so we must make preparations."

即持線丸與尊者阿難：「可持縫衣。」
They handed a spool of thread to Ananda, saying, "You may take it to sew robes."

阿難不取。
Ananda did not accept it.

食後以上因緣，廣白世尊。
After eating, Ananda reported the entire situation to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼難陀、優波難陀來。」
The Buddha said, "Call Nanda and Upananda here."

來已，佛問優波難陀：「如上事，乃至阿難不受汝線，汝實爾不？」
When they came, the Buddha asked Upananda, "Is it true, as Ananda reported, that he did not accept your thread?"

答言：「實爾。」
He replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事。汝不聞，我無數方便讚歎少欲、毀呰多欲？」
The Buddha said, "This is a bad deed. Have you not heard me countless times praising having few desires and condemning having many?"

此非法、非律、不如佛教，不可以是長養善法。
This is not the Dharma, not the discipline, not the Buddha's teaching, and one should not cultivate good practices in this way.

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者盡集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha said to the monks, "Let those residing in Shravasti assemble; I will establish a rule for the benefit of the tenfold. Those who have already heard should hear again."

若比丘自行乞縷，使織師織作衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。
If a monk personally requests threads and gets them woven into robes, it is a nissagiya pācittiya (an offense requiring forfeiture and confession).



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikshu, as mentioned above.




自乞者，勸化索，或一兩、二兩。
Beggars, persuaded to ask, might receive an ounce or two.




縷者，七種縷。
Threads, seven kinds of threads.




织师者，今毗提波昼俱利织师。
Master weaver, now the master weaver of Vidyuppada Dhruva.




織作衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。
The one who weaves clothes is called Nissaggiya Pācittiya.




尼薩耆波夜提者，如上說。
The rule regarding expiation with forfeiture is as stated above.




若比丘自行乞縷，越毘尼心悔。
If a monk requests thread himself, he has broken the Vinaya and should feel remorse.

得者，越毘尼罪。
The one who accepts it, commits an offense against the Vinaya.

織成者，尼薩耆波夜提。
The one who weaves it, incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya offense.




迦尸國土法，比丘安居竟，與縷與織直。
In the land of Kashi, the monks, after residing in peace, engage in giving threads and weaving.

比丘欲織㲲時，應語織師，作是言：「與汝此縷，為我知織㲲。」
When a monk wishes to weave cloth, he should speak to the weaver saying, "I give you this thread, please weave the cloth for me."

織師答言：「尊者！我不解此語？」
The weaver replies, "Venerable one! I do not understand these words."

應問言：「汝家作何等業？」
The monk should ask, "What kind of work does your family do?"

答言：「織㲲。」
The response is, "We weave cloth."

便語言：「汝可為我知織㲲？」
Then the monk says, "Can you weave the cloth for me?"

若復不解此語者，應持線與淨人，令知織，一切不得作雇織語。
If they still do not understand these words, the monk should give the thread to a cleaner, ensuring the weaving is understood without engaging in hiring talk.

若比丘知織腰帶，欲使比丘織者，應持線與，作是言：「長老！為我作帶。」
If a monk knows how to weave a belt and wishes another monk to do so, he should give the thread and say, "Elder! Please make the belt for me."

是故說。
Thus it is said.



佛住舍衛城祇洹精舍，爾時毘舍佉鹿母常日日眾僧中請食。
The Buddha resided in the Jetavana Monastery in the city of Shravasti. At that time, the laywoman Visakha often invited monks for meals.

時有比丘次到其家食，見毘舍佉鹿母持縷與織師，語言：「汝為我織㲲，欲施尊者難陀、優波難陀。彼人難可，汝當為好織。」
Once, a monk happened to arrive at her house for a meal and saw Visakha giving thread to a weaver, saying, "Weave a cloth for me to offer to the venerable Nanda, Upananda. They are hard to please, so make it well."

比丘食已，還精舍，語難陀言：「長老！我欲語汝好事。」問言：「有何好事？」
After eating, the monk returned to the monastery and said to Nanda, "Elder, I have good news for you." Nanda asked, "What is the good news?"

答言：「我見毘舍佉鹿母欲施汝衣。」
The monk replied, "I saw that Visakha is preparing to offer you a robe."

答言：「此不施我衣。何以故？此優婆夷當施賢聖。」
Nanda replied, "This is not meant for me. Why? Because this laywoman always offers to the noble ones."

復言：「不爾，我眼見毘舍佉鹿母，以縷與織師，作是言：『與汝此縷，為我好織作㲲，欲施難陀，彼人難可。』」
The monk insisted, "No, I clearly saw Visakha giving thread to the weaver, saying, 'Here is the thread, weave it well, as it is for Nanda, who is hard to please.'"

問言：「汝知織師家處不？」答言：「知處。」
Nanda asked, "Do you know where the weaver's house is?" The monk replied, "I do know."

即復問言：「彼家在何處？何巷陌？門戶那向？示我標相。」具問知處已，明日著入聚落衣，往到其家。
Nanda then asked, "Where is that house situated? Which street? In which direction is the door? Show me the marks." Having asked all the details, the next day, he put on his village clothes and went to that house.

見織師張經，見已問織師言：「長壽！為誰張經？」答言：「我為鹿母毘舍佉張經。」
Seeing the weaver stretching the warp, he asked, "Long-lived one, for whom are you preparing the loom?" The weaver replied, "I am doing it for the lady Visakha."

復問言：「汝知不？此為誰作？」答言：「我知為難陀、優波難陀。」
He further asked, "Do you know for whom this is made?" The weaver replied, "I know it is for Nanda and Upananda."

復問：「汝識難陀不？」答言：「我不識。」即便語言：「難陀、優波難陀正我等是，汝當好作長廣細緻織。」
Nanda asked again, "Do you recognize Nanda?" The weaver replied, "I do not." Then Nanda said, "Nanda and Upananda are we ourselves, so make the cloth long, wide, and finely woven."

織師答言：「縷自有限、量亦已定，我能無緯織耶？」即復言：「汝但如我語好作，彼家大富，自當更與汝縷。」
The weaver replied, "The thread is limited, and measurements have been set. Can I weave without weft?" Nanda then said, "Just follow my words and weave well; their family is rich and will give you more thread."

織師復言：「彼家與我縷，作直誰當與我？」即言：「汝但好織，織作直我當與汝。」
The weaver said, "They provide thread; who will pay me for my labor?" Nanda replied, "Just weave well, and I will pay you for your labor."

織師言：「若尊者與我織作直，彼復足我縷者，當如教織。」織師即為好織。
The weaver said, "If the venerable one pays me and they provide more thread, I will weave as instructed." The weaver then made it well.

縷盡復往索，如是三索。毘舍佉鹿母念言：「此人但來索縷、不求作直，我何以不足與縷？」
As the thread ran out, he went back for more three times. Visakha thought, "This person only comes to ask for thread, not for labor costs; why shouldn't I continue providing thread?"

與縷織成，廣長細好，送與鹿母。鹿母取已作是言：「此是好㲲，不應與彼是重供養；雖然，本為其作。」即便送與。
So she gave more thread, and the cloth was woven well, being wide, long, and fine, and sent to Visakha. Taking it, Visakha said, "This is good cloth, deserving of proper offering, although it was originally meant for them." So she sent it along.

難陀㲲未成時，日日到織師家。既得㲲已，遠離其舍異巷而行，譬如老烏遠離射方。
Before the cloth was finished, Nanda visited the weaver daily. Once he got the cloth, he avoided the weaver's place, walking in different streets, like an old crow avoiding a shooting place.

織師作務多，不得來索作直。後織師營署率會來到舍衛城，織師爾時便作是念：「眾人未集，我今可往索織直。」
The weaver, being busy with his work, could not go immediately to ask for his wages. Later, when he returned to Shravasti for a gathering, he thought, "Before everyone arrives, I should go ask for my weaving wages."

故往祇洹，到已問諸比丘：「難陀、優波難陀在何處住？」比丘語言：「是處房中。」即入房中，見已禮足問訊。
So he went to Jetavana and asked the monks, "Where does Nanda, Upananda stay?" The monks replied, "In that room." He then entered the room and after seeing them, paid respects and greeted them.

彼佯不識，如未曾相見。即問言：「尊者得㲲未？」反問言：「何等㲲？」
They pretended not to recognize him, as if they had never met. He asked, "Did the venerable one receive the cloth?" Nanda replied with a question, "What cloth?"

答言：「我為鹿母織者。」答言：「得。」問言：「㲲為稱尊者意不？」答言：「為復可耳。」
The weaver answered, "The one I wove for Visakha." Nanda replied, "Yes." The weaver asked, "Was the cloth to the venerable one's liking?" Nanda replied, "It was just acceptable."

便言：「阿闍梨當與我織價。」問言：「何等織價？」
The weaver then said, "Master, please give me the weaving wages." Nanda asked, "What kind of weaving wages?"

答言：「乃至優婆夷足縷，許與我織作直。」彼即瞋恚言：「如是，如是！
The weaver replied, "As promised by the laywoman when enough thread was given." Nanda then angrily said, "So be it!

子賜穀物，汝識難陀、優波難陀不？欲拔汝眼𥇒取虛空中烟，我欲五指撮取淨。
Son, with a gift of grain, don't you know Nanda and Upananda? Want to pluck your eyes and grab smoke in the air? I want to grab purity with five fingers.

洗釜已欲望故得多食，裸形外道猶欲剝取兩張㲲，於死老烏足上望剝取五百兩肉。
After washing a pot, hope to get more food. Naked ascetics still want to strip two sheets of cloth. From the foot of a dead old crow, hope to peel off 500 grams of flesh.

以一把糠散恒水漩淵中，欲收歛取如是等處求物，況復汝望得我物！」
Throw a handful of chaff into the river, wanting to gather and retrieve it. Why do you even hope to get anything from me?"

即語弟子言：「汝取我僧伽梨來，我欲著詣王家，呼人來縛取此人付官。」
He then told his disciple, "Bring me my monk's robe. I want to go to the king's house and call someone to bind this person for the authorities."

織師作是念：「此沙門有大身力，又出入王家，必能為我作不饒益事。用是作直為？但得活命去。」
The weaver thought, "This monk has great strength and influence with the king. He'll surely do me harm. Why bother with the wages? Better to save my life and leave."

怖畏却行出戶。走到率會人中，彼眾人嫌言：「我等各各廢家事，到此間共料理官事。汝今云何妨廢眾人？」
Fearful, he retreated and left. He went to join the gathering, where people complained, "We all abandoned our household duties to manage official matters here. How could you disturb everyone?"

彼即答言：「汝聽鹿母與我縷織㲲。難陀、優波難陀，乃至㲲未成時日日來。
He replied, "Listen, Visakha gave me thread to weave cloth. Nanda and Upananda came daily until the cloth was finished.

得㲲已，猶如老烏遠於射方，乃至思惟但得活命，廣說上事，是故來晚耳。」
After getting the cloth, they avoided me like an old crow from a shooting place. Thought only of survival. Hence, came late today."

眾人即瞋恚言：「此比丘輕易我等不與作直，而反欲使王力縛人，我等今日當作制限，
The group was angry, "These monks slight us by not paying for labor and instead want the king to forcefully take someone away. Today, we should make a resolution

後更不復為沙門織㲲。」有人言：「我等當在隱處共作制限，莫使人知。
that we will no longer weave for the monks." Someone said, "Let's make this decision secretly, so no one will know.

我知沙門衣量，長五肘、廣三肘，長五肘、廣二肘，如是衣量不得織。
I know the monks' robe dimensions: five cubits long by three cubits wide and five cubits long by two cubits wide. Such measurements should not be woven.

若彼人知者，此沙門有力，能使王家以力使人，乃至能為人作不饒益事，莫使人知。」
If they knew, the monks are powerful, able to use the king's power against people, doing harm. We must not let anyone know."

到受歲時，眾人擔縷來詣織師所，欲雇織師織。織師問言：「汝欲作何等量衣？」
During festival season, people brought thread to the weaver, wanting to hire him for weaving. The weaver asked, "What size of clothing do you want?"

答言：「長五肘、廣三肘，長五肘。廣二肘。」織師念言：「此是沙門衣量。」
They answered, "Five cubits long by three wide or five long by two wide." The weaver thought, "This is the monks' robe size."

即答言：「我已為人織，不復得作。」如是遍問，都無織者。
He replied, "I have already woven for someone else, I can't do it again." Thus, asking everywhere, they could find no weaver.

爾時諸富貴家即取家中成織㲲施僧，諸貧人等先無成織者無衣施僧，爾時僧得布施衣少。
At that time, wealthy families took the woven cloth from their homes to offer to the monks, while poor people, who had no ready-made cloth, couldn't offer any robe. Thus, monks received few robes.

佛知而故問：「阿難！僧何以得布施衣少？」
The Buddha, knowing this, asked, "Ananda, why have the monks received so few robes?"

阿難即以上事，乃至織師發不喜心，共作要命，具白世尊。
Ananda then recounted the entire incident, including the weaver's displeasure and agreement to a pact, and reported it all to the World-Honored One.

佛言：「呼難陀來。」來已，佛具問難陀、優波難陀：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」
The Buddha said, "Call Nanda here." When he arrived, the Buddha asked Nanda and Upananda, "Is this true?" They answered, "It is true, World-Honored One!"

佛言：「此是惡事。汝常不聞我讚歎少欲、毀呰多欲耶？」
The Buddha said, "This is a bad deed. Haven't you always heard me praise contentment and condemn greed?" 



佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told the monks: "All those who rely on the city of Sravasti should gather, and for ten benefits, I establish precepts for the monks, so that even those who have heard them should hear them again. 

若居士、居士婦使織師為比丘織作衣。

If a layman or laywoman has a weaver make robes for a monk, 

是比丘先不請，便往勸織師言：『汝知不？此衣為我作，汝當好織，令緻長廣，當與汝錢、錢直，食、食直。』

and the monk did not request it beforehand, yet went to persuade the weaver, saying: 'Do you know? This robe is made for me, you should weave it well, make it fine, long, and wide, and I will give you money, the value of money, food, the value of food.' 

是比丘如是勸與錢、錢直，食、食直，得衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。

If the monk thus persuades by giving money, the value of money, food, the value of food, and obtains the robe, it is a nissaggiya pacittiya offense." 




居士者，家主。
A layman is a householder.

婦者，家主婦。
A woman is a housewife.




為比丘者，

For those who are monks,

若僧、

whether a monk,

若眾多人、

or a large assembly of people,

若一人。

or a single person.




織師者，如上說。  
A weaver, as mentioned above.




衣者，十種，如上說。
There are ten types of clothing, as mentioned above.




先不請者，本不請謂請想，

At first, those who are not invited are considered as seeking an invitation,

請餘人謂己想，

Those who invite others are viewed as having their own wishes,

請與餘物謂衣想。

Asking for other things implies a desire for clothing.




便往者，往田中、家中。
Then go to the fields or home.




勸者，語令細緻、若長廣。
For those who persuade, speak in a detailed and expansive manner.




錢者，種種錢。
Money comes in various forms.

Food includes wheat porridge, barley rice, and fish meat.

直者，錢物。
Value refers to money and goods.

得衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。
Obtaining clothing is known as nissaggiya pācittiya.



尼薩耆波夜提者，如上說。
Nisaggiyāpāyattiyo: As said above.




若比丘語織師言：「與我好織堅織緻打。」作是語時，越毘尼罪。
If a monk tells a weaver, "Weave this firmly and finely for me," he violates the Vinaya rule.

織師下手打織時，下下，波夜提。
When the weaver starts weaving, it is a minor offense for each repetition.

作成得者，尼薩耆波夜提。
Completing the weaving results in a serious offense.

若比丘與織師說法，織師手支頤住聽，比丘語織師言：
If a monk preaches to a weaver who listens with hands supporting their chin, the monk says to the weaver:

「此應耳聽，不應手聽，手可並作。」作是語時，得越毘尼罪。
"You should listen with your ears, not your hands. Your hands can be working." Saying this, he violates the Vinaya rule.

若比丘聞為作衣，往勸不許價，得衣，越毘尼罪。
If a monk hears that a robe is being made and persuades without fixing a price, acquiring the robe violates the Vinaya rule.

聞而往勸，亦許直，得衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。
If he persuades and a price is agreed, acquiring the robe leads to a serious offense.

不聞而往勸，自與，得衣者，越毘尼罪。
If he does not hear but persuades and receives, acquiring the robe violates the Vinaya rule.

不聞不勸亦不與直，得衣者，無罪。
If he neither hears, nor persuades, nor agrees on a price, acquiring the robe is not an offense.

若寡婦施眾僧衣，比丘若僧中次第應得此衣，婦人語比丘言：
If a widow offers a robe to the Sangha and a monk is next to receive it, the woman says to the monk:

「我家無人，尊者可到織師所經營此衣。尊者若自能往料理者，可得疾成，亦可得好。」
"There is no one at my home; Venerable One, you can manage this robe with the weaver. If you can manage it yourself, it can be completed quickly and well."

比丘爾時得往織師所，作如是言：「長壽！汝知疾織、知緻織。」
The monk then may go to the weaver and say, "Long-life! You are skilled at quick weaving and fine weaving."

作是語者無罪。是故說。
Saying this is not an offense. Thus it is said.




，廣說如上。
The Buddha was staying in the city of Shravasti, and he spoke extensively as above.

時六群比丘在一聚落夏安居，初安居時，晨朝著入聚落衣，捉紙筆入聚落中，語諸優婆塞言：「汝等和義與我夏安居衣。」
At that time, six groups of monks were in a village for the summer retreat. At the beginning of the retreat, in the morning, wearing robes suitable for entering the village and carrying paper and pen, they said to the upāsakas, "You should voluntarily give us robes for the summer retreat."

諸優婆塞言：「非索安居衣時，待至秋穀熟。爾時諸人多有歡欣心，當施衣。」
The upāsakas said, "It is not yet the time to request residence robes. Wait until the autumn harvest when people are in a joyful mood, and then robes will be given."

六群比丘言：「汝不知世間多有諸難，若王、水、火、盜賊難，或為汝父母所遮，不得布施。汝便不成功德，我則失利。」
The six groups of monks said, "You do not know that the world has many difficulties, such as those caused by kings, water, fire, or thieves, or your parents might prevent you from giving alms. Thus, you will not have the opportunity to benefit, and we will miss out on robes."

優婆塞言：「尊者！但示我諸難，而自不見諸難。尊者得安居錢已，欲罷道、欲餘行去耶？何以多欲貪求？如是何道之有？」
The upāsakas said, "Venerable ones! You point out the difficulties to us, yet you do not see your own. Do you wish to renounce the path and go elsewhere after receiving the residence robes? Why are you so eager and greedy in your requests? What kind of path is this?"

諸比丘聞已，即以上事具白世尊。
Upon hearing this, the other monks reported the matter in full to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」來已，佛問六群比丘：「汝實初安居時，從諸優婆塞索安居衣，為諸優婆塞呵責耶？」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here." Once they arrived, the Buddha asked them, "Did you truly ask the upāsakas for residence robes at the start of the summer retreat, and were you scolded by the upāsakas?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "Yes, it is true."

佛告比丘：「此是惡事，安居未訖，而先求衣。從今日安居未訖，不得先求安居衣。」
The Buddha told the monks, "This is a wrongful act. Before the summer retreat is over, you should not ask for robes in advance. From today onward, you may not request residence robes before the retreat concludes."



衛城，
Furthermore, the Buddha was residing in Shravasti,

爾時波斯匿王大臣名彌尼剎利叛逆，
at that time, a minister of King Prasenajit named Minishashli rebelled,

王遣一大臣名仙人達多往討伐之。
the king sent a minister named Xianrendaduo to suppress him.

此大臣臨欲行時，
As this minister was about to set out,

往到尊者阿難所，
he went to Venerable Ananda,

白言尊者：
and said, Venerable:

「波斯匿王大臣叛逆，
"A minister of King Prasenajit has rebelled,

王今遣我往伐，
the king is now sending me to attack him,

方向強敵身命難保。
facing a strong enemy, my life is in jeopardy.

我常年年安居竟飯僧施衣，
Every year during the monastic retreat, I offer meals and robes to monks,

我今為官所使、不得待時，
now being on official duty, I cannot wait,

欲先施衣；
I wish to offer robes first;

得安隱還者，後當施食。」
if I return safely, I will offer food later."

尊者阿難即以上事具白世尊，
Venerable Ananda reported this matter to the World Honored One,

佛知而故問阿難：
the Buddha, knowing this, asked Ananda:

「汝安居餘有幾日在？」
"How many days are left in your retreat?"

答言：「十日。」
He replied: "Ten days."

佛言：
The Buddha said:

「從今日聽未到自恣十日得受急施衣。」
"From today, within the ten days before the invitation, you may accept urgently offered robes."

佛告諸比丘：
The Buddha told the monks:

「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，
"Let all residing in Shravasti gather,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，
for their tenfold benefit, I establish the precept for monks,

乃至已聞者當重聞。
those who have already heard it should hear it again.

若十日未滿夏三月得急施衣，
If before ten days, in the third month of summer, urgent robes are offered,

比丘須者得自手取，
monks in need may personally receive them,

畜至衣時。
and store them until robe season.

若過時畜者，尼薩耆波夜提。」
If stored beyond this period, it is an offence of expiation requiring forfeiture."



十日者，從七月六日至七月十五日，是名十日。
The ten days are from July 6th to July 15th; this is called the ten days.




得急施衣者，若女、若男、若大、若小、若在家、出家。
The recipients of urgent offerings of clothes may be female, male, adult, child, layperson, or ordained.

若欲軍征行時與、征還時與、死時與、女人還歸時與、商人去時與，
If they wish to give during military campaigns, upon return from campaigns, at the time of death, when women return home, or when traders leave,

施主語比丘言：「若今日不取，明日無。」
the donor says to the Buddhist monk, "If you do not take it today, there will be none tomorrow."

是名急施衣。
This is called an urgent offering of clothes.




衣者，七種，如上說。
Clothing, seven types, as stated above.




欲取者，若須此物應取，畜至衣時。
If you desire to take, when needed, this item should be taken and kept until it becomes clothing.




衣時者，若無迦絺那衣，得至八月十五日；
The allowable time for wearing robes, if there are no Kaṭhina robes, is until the fifteenth day of the eighth month;

有迦絺那衣，得至臘月十五日。
If there are Kaṭhina robes, it is allowed until the fifteenth day of the twelfth month.

若過時畜者，尼薩耆波夜提。
If one keeps them beyond the allowed time, it constitutes a niṣkṛtaka prayascitta offense.




尼薩耆波夜提者，如上說。
Nisagghiya pacittiya, as previously stated.




法成就，僧應拜作勸化分衣人。

Monks who have accomplished five qualities should be appointed by the assembly to distribute robes.

何等五？不隨愛、不隨瞋、不隨怖、不隨癡、得不得知，是名五法。

What are the five? Not following desire, not following anger, not following fear, not following delusion, and knowing whether something is obtained or not. These are called the five qualities.

作羯磨法者應作是說：「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，若僧時到，僧拜某甲比丘作勸化分衣人。白如是。」

When performing the karma procedure, one should say: "Venerable assembly! Monk so-and-so has accomplished the five qualities. When the time is right, the assembly appoints Monk so-and-so to distribute robes. I declare it thus."

「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，僧今拜某甲比丘為勸化分衣人。諸大德忍某甲比丘為僧作勸化分衣人者僧默然，若不忍便說。」

"Venerable assembly! Monk so-and-so has accomplished the five qualities. The assembly now appoints Monk so-and-so as the distributor of robes. If the venerable ones consent to Monk so-and-so being the distributor of robes, the assembly should remain silent; if not, please speak."

「僧已忍拜某甲比丘作勸化分衣人竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」

"The assembly has silently consented to appoint Monk so-and-so as the distributor of robes; thus, it is held."

受羯磨已，應白僧作是言：「諸大德！衣相降四指八指不等，若通此者我當分。」

After completing the karma, one should announce to the assembly: "Venerable ones! The sizes of the robes vary, four to eight fingers wide. If it is acceptable, I will distribute them."

若不白而分，越毘尼罪。如上白已當分。

If one distributes without declaring, it constitutes an offense against the Vinaya. Having declared as above, one should proceed with the distribution.

是比丘從三月十六日，應語諸檀越：「捉紙筆條，房舍、講堂溫室、禪坊門屋、食厨淨水屋、廁屋薪屋浴室、樹下坐處、經行處盡疏名。」

From the sixteenth day of the third month, the monk should tell the patrons: "Take paper and pen and list all dwellings, lecture halls, warm rooms, meditation halls, doorhouses, kitchens, clean water houses, toilet houses, firewood houses, bathrooms, tree sitting places, and walking paths."

應僧中唱：「大德僧聽！某甲住處有爾許床褥、爾許安居衣、爾許食、爾許齋日飲食、爾許呪願物。」

In the assembly, one should announce: "Venerable assembly! At the dwelling of so-and-so, there are such numbers of beds and mattresses, residence robes, food, fasting day meals, and wishing articles."

某住處有爾許阿練若住處，若左右諸精舍遠者，十二日十三日時應分房舍。

At some dwellings, there are certain numbers of forest dwellings. If distant from respective monasteries, rooms should be distributed on the twelfth or thirteenth day.

若是住處不相容受者，得餘處去。

If a dwelling cannot accommodate everyone, they may go to other places.

若近聚落中有精舍者，十四日十五日當分條疏，此房舍床褥與上座，當白僧：「某甲住處，有爾許房舍床褥，與上座隨意取。」

If there is a monastery near a village, allocations should be made on the fourteenth or fifteenth day. The rooms and beds should be assigned to the elders. One should declare to the assembly: "At the dwelling of so-and-so, there are such numbers of rooms and beds available for the elders to choose at will."

取已次與第二、第三，乃至無歲比丘。

After elders have chosen, they are given to the second, third, and so on, up to monks without seniority.

上座應作是言：「房舍次第住，布施物應平等與。」

Elders should say: "Rooms should be allocated in order of seniority, and donations should be distributed equally."

爾時應隨上座處分。上座取已，應次第與第二、第三亦如是，乃至無歲比丘。

At that time, distribution should follow the order of seniority. Once elders have taken, it should be in sequence for the second and third, and so on, to monks without seniority.

若房多者應一人與二房，與二房時若不肯取者，應語言：「此為治事故與，不為受用故與。」

If there are many rooms, one person can be assigned two rooms. If someone is unwilling to take two rooms, they should be told: "This is given for management purposes, not for personal use."

不得與沙彌二房。

It is not allowed to give two rooms to novices.

若房舍少者，二人共房。如是房猶不足者，當三人共、若四人共、五人乃至十人共與一房。

If rooms are few, two people share a room. If even then the rooms are insufficient, three, four, or up to ten people may share one room.

若有大堂、若溫室、若禪坊、若講堂，一切共入中。

If there is a main hall, warm room, meditation hall, or lecture hall, all can share it jointly.

若不受者，上座與臥床，年少與坐床。

If not accepted, elders get lying beds, and juniors get sitting beds.

若復不受者，上座與坐床，年少敷地床。

If still not accepted, elders get sitting beds, and juniors spread mats on the floor.

若復不受者，與上座草褥，年少結跏趺坐。

If still not accepted, elders get grass mats, and juniors sit cross-legged.

若復不受者，上座應坐，年少應立住。

If still not accepted, elders should sit, and juniors should stand.

若復不受者，上座當立，年少出去，若樹下、若餘處。

If still not accepted, elders should stand, and juniors may go outside, under trees or elsewhere.

是比丘六月十六日已後，應當語諸檀越：「長壽！各各辦衣。」

After the sixteenth day of the sixth month, the monk should inform the donors: "Dear donors! Please prepare robes individually."

爾時檀越若與者，應語言：「且著汝邊，須待時與。」

When the donors provide, they should be told: "Keep them with you for now, and give them at the appropriate time."

若欲軍征去與、若征還與、若死時與、商人去時與、女人歸家時與，若今日不取、明日無，爾時應取。

If given when going to battle, when returning, at the time of death, when merchants depart, or when women return home, and if not taken today and unavailable tomorrow, they should be taken then.

七月五日已後有此衣來，取著一處，若樹葉、樹皮當取數記，爾許時衣、爾許非時衣、爾許急施衣。

After the fifth day of the seventh month, if robes arrive, keep them in one place, and count the leaves, bark, and record the number of timely robes, untimely robes, and urgently donated robes.

時衣時分、非時衣非時分、急施衣時分。

Timely robes are distributed in their time; untimely robes in their time; urgently donated robes in their time.

若分衣人，若罷道、若死，不得分衣。

If the person distributing robes is dismissed or dies, they are not allowed to distribute robes.

若時過，應如是貿衣分：比丘尼衣應與比丘，比丘衣應與比丘尼。

If the time passes, robes should be exchanged and distributed as follows: nuns' robes should be given to monks, and monks' robes should be given to nuns.

若如是不得者，沙彌衣應與比丘，比丘衣應與沙彌。

If still not obtainable, novices' robes should be given to monks, and monks' robes to novices.

若復不得者，應眾僧中白言：「諸大德！衣時已過，眾僧和合，作四方僧臥具，若聽者得作四方僧臥具。」

If still not obtainable, one should declare to the assembly: "Venerable ones! The time for robes has passed. The assembly is united to create communal bedding. If permitted, it will be made into communal bedding."

若有人言：「我等夏安居住，得此衣分，何以作四方僧用？」

If someone says, "We lived here during the rainy season and received these robes. Why make them communal?"

應語此人：「待來年衣時，當與汝。」

One should respond: "Wait until the next robe season, and then they will be given to you."

是故說。

Thus it is said


，爾時諸比丘阿練若處夏安居。  
Buddha stayed in the city of Sravasti, and at that time the monks were residing in the forest for the summer retreat.

諸比丘時到入聚落乞食，後放牛羊人、取薪草人，持戶鉤來開諸比丘房戶偷衣物。  
The monks often went into the village to beg for food, and later, herders and firewood collectors used hooks to open the monks' rooms and steal their belongings.

時諸比丘畏偷故，盡持衣物入聚落。  
Fearing theft, the monks brought their belongings with them into the village.

佛知而故問：「此何等比丘運致來此？」  
The Buddha, knowing this, asked, "Why are the monks bringing their belongings here?"

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！是諸比丘在阿練若處安居乞食去，後有人持戶鉤，於後開戶偷諸衣物，是以運致來此。」  
The monks reported to the Buddha, "World-Honored One! The monks reside and beg for food in the forest, but later, people use hooks to open their rooms and steal their belongings, which is why they bring them here."

佛言：「從今日後恐畏時，聽三衣中若一一衣，得寄著聚落內。」  
The Buddha said, "From now on, if there is a fear of theft, you are allowed to leave one of your three robes in the village.


復次佛住舍衛城祇洹精舍，沙祇國夏安居中眾僧有諍事起，如法滅。
Once the Buddha was residing in the Jetavana Monastery in Shravasti, and during the summer retreat in Shakya Country, a dispute arose among the monks, which was resolved according to the law.

佛語優波離：「汝往沙祇國，與眾僧如法滅此諍事。」
The Buddha said to Upali, "You should go to Shakya Country and, in accordance with the law, resolve the monks' dispute."

時長老優波離辭不去，佛問優波離：「汝何以不去？」
At that time, Elder Upali refused to go, and the Buddha asked, "Upali, why won't you go?"

答言：「世尊！我僧伽梨重，若被雨者不可勝；而今半安居中，若留衣者，尼薩耆。」
He replied, "World-Honored One! My robe is thick and loses a lot if it gets wet; now in the middle of the summer retreat, if I leave my robes, I'll be committing an infraction."

佛問優波離：「汝幾日可得往還？」
The Buddha asked Upali, "How many days would it take for you to go and return?"

優波離白佛言：「世尊！計去二日、停二日、來二日，都計六宿，可得往返。」
Upali replied to the Buddha, "World-Honored One! It would take two days to go, two days to stay, and two days to return, totaling six nights."

佛言：「從今日後留衣得齊六宿。」
The Buddha said, "From today onward, you may leave your robes for up to six nights."

優波離到彼已，見此諍事難可卒滅，即便來還。
Upali went there and saw that the dispute was hard to resolve immediately, and then he returned.

還已禮世尊足，却住一面，佛知而故問：「優波離！汝來還何故速，僧中諍事竟得滅不？」
After returning, he paid respect to the World-Honored One's feet and stood aside; the Buddha knowingly asked, "Upali, why did you return so quickly? Was the dispute among the monks resolved?"

答言：「未滅。世尊！」
He replied, "It was not resolved, World-Honored One!"

佛言：「何以故？」
The Buddha asked, "Why?"

答言：「諍事難滅非可卒斷，復畏日過失衣犯尼薩耆，是故來還。」
He said, "The dispute was hard to resolve and could not be cut off immediately, and I feared that if too many days passed, I'd commit the infraction of losing my robes, so I came back."

佛言：「從今日聽一月不失衣宿。」
The Buddha said, "From today, you are allowed not to lose your robes for a month."

作羯磨僧應與求聽作一月不失衣宿羯磨。
The monks performing the act should request and be allowed to perform the act of not losing robes for a month.

羯磨者應作是說：「大德僧聽！長老優波離今向沙祇國，為僧滅諍事。若僧時到，優波離欲從僧乞一月不失衣宿羯磨。」
The one doing the act should say, "Venerable monks, listen! Elder Upali is now going to Shakya Country to resolve the monks' dispute. If the time is right for the monks, Upali wants to request the act of not losing his robes for a month."

「諸大德聽！優波離欲從僧乞一月不失衣宿羯磨，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
"Venerable monks, listen! Upali wants to request from the monks the act of not losing robes for a month. If the monks agree and remain silent, this matter is thus held."

應從僧中乞，作是言：「大德僧聽！我優波離比丘，欲向沙祇國為僧滅諍事。唯願大德僧與我一月不失衣宿羯磨。」
One should request from the monks, saying, "Venerable monks, listen! I, Bhikkhu Upali, wish to go to Shakya Country to resolve the monks' dispute. May the venerable monks grant me the act of not losing robes for a month."

如是第二、第三乞。
Such a request should be made a second and a third time.

羯磨人當作是說：「大德僧聽！長老優波離，欲往沙祇國為僧滅諍事，已從僧中乞一月不失衣宿羯磨。」
The one doing the act should say, "Venerable monks, listen! Elder Upali wishes to go to Shakya Country to resolve the monks' dispute and has requested the act of not losing robes for a month from the monks."

若僧時到，僧與優波離一月不失衣宿羯磨。
If the time is right for the monks, they should grant Upali the act of not losing robes for a month.

白如是。
Thus it was stated.

「大德僧聽！長老優波離，欲向沙祇國為僧滅諍事，已從僧乞一月不失衣宿。」
"Venerable monks, listen! Elder Upali wishes to go to Shakya Country to resolve the monks' dispute and has requested not to lose robes for a month from the monks.

僧今已與長老優波離一月不失衣宿羯磨。
The monks have now granted Elder Upali the act of not losing robes for a month.

諸大德忍與優波離一月不失衣宿羯磨者默然，若不忍便說，是初羯磨。
Those venerable ones who agree to grant Upali the act of not losing robes for a month remain silent. If one does not agree, speak up, as this is the initial act.

第二、第三亦如是說。
The second and third times should be stated similarly.

「僧已與優波離一月不失衣宿竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
"The monks have granted Upali the act of not losing robes for a month, and as the monks agreed in silence, this matter is thus held."

佛問諸比丘：「已與優波離一月不失衣宿羯磨未？」
The Buddha asked the monks, "Have you granted Upali the act of not losing robes for a month?"

答言：「已與。」
They replied, "We have granted it."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者盡集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Those residing in Shravasti should all gather, and for ten benefits, this rule is established for the monks, even those who have already heard should hear it again."

夏三月未滿，比丘在阿練若處住，有恐怖疑，比丘三衣中若一一衣，得寄著家內。
Before the three months of summer are over, if a monk dwelling in a forest has fear or doubts, he may leave one of his three robes in a household.

比丘有因緣事，得齊六宿。
A monk with a reason may stay for up to six nights.

若過者，除僧羯磨，尼薩耆波夜提。
If exceeded, except by the monks' act, it is a nissaggiya pācittiya offense.



安居三月者，從四月十六日至七月十五日。
For those who settle for three months, it is from April 16th to July 15th.

未滿者，未至八月十五日。
For those who have not completed it, it is until August 15th.

比丘未至末月中，在阿練若處住。
Monks who do not reach the end of the month stay in the forest retreat.




阿練若處者，長五肘弓五百弓中間無有放牧人屋，

Āraṇya places are those where there are no herders' dwellings within five cubits and 500 bows in length.

是名阿練若處。

This is called an Āraṇya place.




恐怖者，若殺劫奪。  
The terrorist, like a murderer, plunders.




疑者，雖無殺劫奪，有疑心畏須臾間當殺人奪人衣。
The doubter, though not killing or looting, is afraid in the moment of doubt that he may commit murder and robbery.

若比丘知如是恐怖處。
If a monk knows such a place of fear.




三衣中若一一衣者，僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會。
Among the three robes, if one wears a single robe, it is either the outer robe, the upper garment, or the inner robe.

不得寄僧伽梨、安陀會，得寄欝多羅僧著聚落中家。
One cannot leave the outer robe or inner robe in a village house but can leave the upper garment there.




內者，俗人家不得寄，

For insiders, lay families cannot send items,

可信人家當還寄，

Trustworthy families can send items back,

可疑家疑家作是念：

Suspicious families think this way:

「諸比丘等皆不可復得皆悉防備。」

"All monks and so on cannot be attained again, all are guarded."

諸比丘等若有因緣，

If monks and others have cause,

為塔、為僧事得齊六夜。

For building a stupa, for monastic affairs, they are allowed up to six nights.



六夜者，限齊六宿。

Six nights are limited to six accommodations.




除僧羯磨者，世尊說無罪。
Except for the Sangha karma, the World-Honored One says there is no sin.

若僧羯磨不成就，不名羯磨。
If the Sangha karma is not accomplished, it is not called karma.

羯磨不成就者，眾不成就、白不成就、羯磨不成就。
Karma not accomplished means the assembly is not accomplished, the motion is not accomplished, the karma is not accomplished.

若白成就、羯磨成就、眾成就，是名僧作羯磨。
If the motion is accomplished, karma is accomplished, the assembly is accomplished, it is called the Sangha performing karma.

若僧中受羯磨已，不得為待供養故住，應當疾去。
If one has received karma in the Sangha, one should not stay waiting for offerings, but should quickly leave.

若食前作羯磨，食後應去。
If karma is done before eating, one should leave after eating.

食後受羯磨者，明日晨朝應去。
If karma is received after eating, one should leave the next morning.

去時不得迴道逐檀越，當直道去。
When leaving, one should not circle back following donors but go straight on the path.

若直道有難者，若師子難、虎狼難、毒虫難、失命難，爾時迴道去無罪。
If the direct path has difficulties like lions, tigers, venomous insects, or life-threatening risks, then taking a detour is blameless.

到彼已不得停待供養客比丘飲食。
Once arrived, one should not stay waiting to offer food and drink to guest monks.

若食前到，食後便集僧滅諍事。
If one arrives before eating, one should gather the Sangha to resolve disputes after eating.

若食後到，清旦便集僧滅諍事。
If one arrives after eating, gather the Sangha to resolve disputes at dawn.

若食後斷事訖，便清旦還。
If resolving issues is completed after eating, one should return at dawn.

若食前斷事訖，食後便還，不得住待客比丘供養。
If issues are resolved before eating, return after eating without staying to offer to guest monks.

還時不得從迴道來，當從直道還。
When returning, one should not take a roundabout path but return via the direct path.

若有難者，如上說。
If there are difficulties, as stated above.

初往到彼時，不得誦經、熏鉢、染衣。
At the initial arrival, one should not chant scriptures, perfume bowls, or dye robes.

若斷事訖，有長功夫得誦經作餘事。
If matters are resolved, with ample time, one may chant scriptures and do other tasks.

若事難斷者，中間得誦經、熏鉢，亦得受客比丘供養飲食，無罪。
If matters are difficult to resolve, in the meantime, one may chant scriptures, perfume bowls, and can accept food and drink offerings to guest monks without blame.




滅諍事時不得輒爾取人，當於眾中若堪能、有威德力勢者，

During the time of resolving disputes, one should not randomly choose people; among the community, choose those who are capable and possess authority and power.

若阿練若住處寄衣，得著家內，六夜。

If staying at a remote dwelling, one may store their robes within the home for six nights.

若過六夜者，尼薩耆波夜提。

If it exceeds six nights, it is considered an offense.

是比丘欲捨衣，法當請持律，如上第一戒中說，是故說。

If a monk wishes to relinquish the robe, they must follow the rule as stated in the first precept above.



，有一乞食比丘，時到著入聚落衣，持鉢入城，次行乞食。

The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, when a monk, who lived by begging for alms, donned his alms-begging robe and entered the city, proceeding from house to house.

到一家，有一女人語比丘言：「尊者！某日我當供養僧并施僧衣。」

At one house, a woman said to the monk, "Venerable Sir! One day, I intend to offer food to the Sangha and provide robes for the monks."

比丘言：「善哉姊妹！以三不堅法，易三堅法身命財也，應疾為之，財物無常多有諸難。」

The monk replied, "Well said, sister! By exchanging the three kinds of impermanence — the body, life, and wealth — for the three kinds of firmness, you should do it quickly, for wealth is impermanent and fraught with many difficulties."

作是語已，便還精舍，語諸比丘言：「我欲語汝好事。」

Having said this, he returned to the temple and said to the other monks, "I want to tell you something good."

諸比丘言：「有何等好事？」

The monks asked, "What good thing is this?"

答言：「我聞某甲優婆夷欲供僧飯食、布施僧衣。」

He answered, "I have heard that such-and-such a female lay devotee intends to provide food and robes to the monks."

時六群比丘聞此語已，更問言：「汝說何等？」

Then, when the six groups of monks heard this, they asked further, "What did you say?"

答言：「我聞某甲優婆夷欲供僧飯食并布施衣。」

He replied, "I have heard that such-and-such a female lay devotee intends to provide food and robes to the monks."

問言：「汝知其家處不？為在何巷？門戶那向？」

They asked, "Do you know where her house is located? In which alley is it? In which direction does the door face?"

具問已，晨朝著入聚落衣，往到其家見已，問言：「長壽！安隱不？」

Having asked in detail, in the morning they donned their alms-begging robes, went to her house, saw her, and asked, "Do you live long and in peace?"

答言：「安隱。」

She replied, "In peace."

語優婆夷言：「我聞汝欲供僧飯食、布施僧衣，為實爾不？」

They said to the female lay devotee, "We heard you intend to offer food and robes to the monks, is this true?"

答言：「尊者！我有是心，但恐中間多有難事，知得成不？」

She replied, "Venerable Sir! I have this intention, but I fear many difficulties may arise in the meantime, and I may not be able to fulfill it."

即語言：「如我先出家長宿比丘，汝若施衣者，我當著入王家，禮敬世尊、若貴勝家。」

They immediately said, "Like us, senior monks, if you provide robes, we will go to the king's house, pay homage to the Blessed One, or to noble families."

若人問我：『汝何處得？』

If someone asks me, 'Where did you get it from?'

我當答：『某信心優婆夷邊得。』

I would answer, 'From such-and-such a faithful female lay devotee.'

如是汝得好名稱，為眾所識。」

In this way, you will gain a good reputation and be well-known among people."

優婆夷言：「我家更無有物，我正欲與僧者若與阿闍梨，我已許僧；我若有者，亦當別與阿闍梨亦與僧。」

The female lay devotee said, "I have nothing else in my house. I intend to give to the Sangha and if I have more, I will separately give to the teacher as well as the monks."

比丘言：「與以不與，自從汝意。」

The monk said, "Whether you give or not is up to your own will."

作是語已，便出去。

Having said this, they left.

去已優婆夷作是思惟：「我若當與是比丘，不與僧者，僧是良福田。」

After they left, the female lay devotee thought, "If I give to these monks but not to the Sangha, the Sangha is a good field of merit."

若不與是比丘者，是比丘於王邊有力，能為我作不饒益事。

If I do not give to these monks, this monk has influence with the king and can do things to not benefit me."

以是故不與僧，瞋比丘故，亦復不與。」

For this reason, I did not give to the Sangha, and out of anger toward the monk, also did not give."

諸比丘聞已，以是事往白世尊。

The monks, having heard this, reported the matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼難陀、優波難陀來。」

The Buddha said, "Call Nanda and Upananda to come."

來已，佛廣問上事：「汝實爾不？」

When they came, the Buddha asked extensively about the matter, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」

They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，有二不可，令施者失福，受者失衣。」

The Buddha said, "This is a bad affair with two unacceptable aspects; it causes the giver to lose merit and the receiver to lose robes."

佛語難陀、優波難陀：「汝常不聞我以無數方便，讚歎少欲、毀呰多欲？」

The Buddha said to Nanda and Upananda, "Have you not often heard me, by numerous means, praise having few desires and criticize having many desires?"

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」

This is not Dharma, not discipline, not according to the Buddha's teaching; it cannot be the way to cultivate good virtues."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者，皆悉令集以十利故，與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」

The Buddha told the monks, "Those residing in Shravasti, all should gather for the sake of the ten benefits, and I will set the Precepts for the monks, even if you have already heard them, you should hear them again."

若比丘知物向僧，自迴向己，尼薩耆波夜提。」

If a monk knows that something is meant for the Sangha but redirects it to himself, he commits an offense entailing a formal meeting of the Sangha.


比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as described above.




知者，若自知、若從他聞。
The wise, whether through self-awareness or through hearing from others.

向者，意趣選物向僧。
In the past, the intent was to choose objects for monks.




僧者，八種：
There are eight types of monks:

比丘僧、
Buddhist monks,

比丘尼僧、
Buddhist nuns,

客僧、
Visiting monks,

去僧、
Departed monks,

舊住僧、
Resident monks,

安居僧、
Monks in retreat,

和合僧、
United monks,

不和合僧。
Disunited monks.




自向者，自畜、自用、自入，尼薩耆波夜提。
The offender owns, uses, or consumes for themselves, which constitutes a Nissaggiya Pācittiya offense.

此物應僧中捨，波夜提罪應悔過。
These items should be relinquished to the community of monks, and the Pācittiya offense should be confessed.

若不捨而悔者，得越毘尼罪。
If someone confesses without relinquishing, they incur a Vinaya transgression.



波夜提者，如上說。
Prajñaparamita, as mentioned above.




若有人來欲有布施，問比丘言：「尊者！我欲布施，應施何處耶？」

If someone comes wanting to make an offering and asks a monk, "Venerable! I wish to make an offering, where should it be given?"

比丘應答言：「隨汝心所敬處便與。」

The monk should reply, "Give it wherever your heart reveres."

施主復問：「何處果報多？」

The donor asks again, "Where will the merit be the greatest?"

答言：「施僧果報多。」

The answer is, "Offering to the Sangha yields the greatest merit."

施主復問：「何等清淨持戒，有功德僧？」

The donor asks further, "What kind of pure and virtuous monks have merit?"

比丘應答言：「僧無有犯戒不清淨。」

The monk should answer, "The Sangha has no impurities of broken precepts."

若人持物來施，比丘應語言：「施僧者得大果報。」

If a person brings things to offer, the monk should say, "Offering to the Sangha brings great merit."

若言：「我已曾施僧，今正欲施尊者。」比丘受者無罪。

If someone says, "I have already offered to the Sangha, now I wish to offer to the venerable." The monk who accepts is without fault.

若人問比丘言：「我欲以此物布施，為置何處，使我此物長見受用？」

If someone asks a monk, "I wish to offer this item, where should I place it for prolonged benefit?"

爾時應語：「某甲比丘是坐禪、誦經、持戒，若施彼者長見受用。」

At that time, he should say, "A certain monk is practicing meditation, reciting scriptures, and observing precepts; offering to him will bring prolonged benefit."

若知物向僧，迴向己，尼薩耆波夜提。

If it is known that the item is meant for the Sangha, but redirected towards oneself, it incurs the offence of Nissaggiya Pācittiya.

迴與餘人，波夜提。

Redirecting to another person incurs the Pācittiya offense.

知物向此僧，迴與餘僧者，越毘尼罪。

If knowing it is meant for a certain monk and redirecting it to another monk, it violates the Vinaya.

知向此眾多人，迴與彼眾多人，越毘尼罪。

Knowing it is meant for a certain group of people and redirecting it to another group, violates the Vinaya.

知物向此畜生，迴與餘畜生，越毘尼心悔。

If it is meant for a certain animal and redirected to another animal, it incurs regret under the Vinaya.

知物向僧，自迴向己者，尼薩耆波夜提。

If one knows the item is meant for the Sangha but redirects it to oneself, it incurs the offence of Nissaggiya Pācittiya.

是物眾僧應不與，眾僧應受用，是故說。(三十事竟)

This item should not be given by the congregation; it should be used by the congregation. Thus it is said. (End of the thirty matters.)
