明三十尼薩耆波夜提法之三
Understanding the Thirty Nisaghiya Pācittiya Rules - Part 3




佛住王舍城迦蘭陀竹園，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in Bamboo Grove, Kalanda Nivapa, in Rajagaha, expounding as above.

爾時周羅聚落主到世尊所，頭面禮足却住一面，白佛言：「世尊！前日眾多大臣、婆羅門、居士、長者，集王殿上作如是論，有言：『沙門釋子應畜金銀。』有言：『不應畜。』何者實語、法語、隨順法，於現法中不逆論？」
At that time, the village headman of Velligama came to the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, the other day many ministers, Brahmins, and householders gathered in the royal hall and debated: 'Should the Sakyans' disciples possess gold and silver?' Some said, ‘They should.’ Others said, ‘They should not.’ What is the truth, the words of the Dharma, in accordance with the Dharma, not contradicting the present Dharma?"

佛言：「沙門釋子不應畜金銀。若有人言：『應畜金銀。』是誹謗我，非實、非法、非隨順，於現法中是為逆論。
The Buddha replied, "The Sakyans' disciples should not possess gold or silver. If someone says, 'They should possess gold and silver,' they slander me, speaking untruths, not in accordance with the Dharma, and going against the present Dharma.

何以故？若得畜金銀者，亦應得畜五欲。何等五？一者眼分別色愛染著，乃至身受觸愛染著，當知是非沙門釋種法。」
Why? Because if they possess gold and silver, they should also indulge in the five sensual pleasures. What are the five? The eyes become attached to visible forms, and so on until the body experiences touch and becomes enamored and entangled, which you should know is not the way of the mendicant Sakyans.”

聚落主言：「甚奇，世尊！未曾有也，世尊！
The village headman said, "How marvelous, World-Honored One! This was never known, World-Honored One!

如世尊說：『沙門釋子不應畜金銀。若畜金銀者，非沙門法、非釋種法。』
As the World-Honored One has said, 'The Sakyans' disciples should not possess gold and silver. If they possess gold and silver, it is not the practice of mendicants, not the way of the Sakyans.'

是故我今歸依佛、歸依法、歸依僧。我是佛優婆塞離殺生，世尊當證知。
Therefore, I now take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. As a lay follower of the Buddha, I refrain from taking life; may the World-Honored One bear witness to this.

如是三說，乃至不飲酒。我先時有是念：『沙門釋子不應畜金銀，若畜者無異受五欲人。』」
In the same way, I further resolve up to abstaining from drinking alcohol. I previously thought, 'The Sakyans' disciples should not possess gold and silver; those who do are no different from those indulging in the five sensual pleasures.'"

爾時世尊即為聚落主，隨順說法示教利喜，如染淨㲲易為受色，即於坐上見四聖諦。
At that time, the World-Honored One taught the village headman in accordance with the Dharma for his benefit and delight, like dye spreading through a pure cloth, and he immediately saw the Four Noble Truths while seated.

見四聖諦已白佛言：「世尊！俗人多務，當還請辭。」
Having seen the Four Noble Truths, he said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, householders have many duties and I must now take my leave."

佛言：「宜知是時。」
The Buddha replied, "You may know the right time."

起禮佛足右遶而去。
He rose, paid his respects at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated to the right, and departed.

去不久佛往眾多比丘所，敷尼師檀坐已，語諸比丘：「向周羅聚落主來到我所，如上廣說，乃至右遶而去。」
Not long after he left, the Buddha went to where many monks were, set up his meditation seat, and told the monks, "The village headman of Velligama came to me and I spoke to him about matters as described above, until he circumambulated and left."

佛告諸比丘：「汝等當如是學，不得畜金銀，我無有方便得畜金銀。」
The Buddha instructed the monks, "You should learn in this way, not to possess gold and silver, for I have no means to permit the possession of gold and silver."



衛城，廣說如上。
Once again, the Buddha stayed in the city of Sravasti and expounded as mentioned above.

世尊以五事利益故，五日一行諸比丘房，見難陀、優波難陀住處。
For the benefit of five matters, the World-Honored One visited the monks' quarters every five days and saw the residence of Nanda and Upananda.

時難陀、優波難陀數錢，手上著土，往詣世尊頭面禮足却住一面，
At that time, Nanda and Upananda were counting money, their hands soiled. They approached the World-Honored One, paid respects at his feet, and stood aside.

佛知而故問：「手上何以著土？」
The Buddha knew but asked, "Why are your hands soiled?"

答言：「世尊！我數錢故手上有土。」
They replied, "World-Honored One, my hands are soiled because I was counting money."

佛語難陀：「汝等云何手自捉生色、似色，從今日不聽手自持生色、似色。」
The Buddha said to Nanda, "Why do you handle raw colors and similar things? From today, you are not allowed to hold raw colors and similar things with your hands.


舍離大林重閣精舍，廣說如上。  
Furthermore, the Buddha was residing in the Great Forest Monastery with multiple tiers in Vesali, elaborating as before.

時優陀夷時到著入聚落衣持鉢，至一泥師家，其家始作節會訖。  
At that time, Udāyin, upon the appropriate time, donned the robe, took up his alms bowl, and arrived at a potter's house as they were finishing a celebration.

其婦出迎作禮問言：「尊者！昨日何以不來？若來者當得好飲食。」  
The woman of the house came out to greet him and asked, "Venerable! Why did you not come yesterday? You would have received good food."

答言：「昨日、今日復何在耶？若有好食便可持來。」  
He replied, "Yesterday, where am I again today? If there is good food, you may bring it."

白言：「好食已盡，今與尊者錢，可於店上易好食。」  
She said, "The good food is gone. Now I give you money, Venerable, to exchange for good food at the shop."

答言：「世尊制戒，不聽我自手捉錢。汝可以錢繫我衣角。」  
He replied, "The World-Honored One established a rule prohibiting me from handling money directly. You may tie the money to the corner of my robe."

即如其言繫錢而去。  
So, she tied the money to his robe and left.

至市肆上語言：「長壽！與我餅來。」  
At the market, he said, "Long-life! Bring me some cakes."

答言：「尊者！示我錢來。」  
He responded, "Venerable! Show me the money."

優陀夷言：「但與我餅，我不動此處，當與汝錢。」  
Udāyin said, "Just give me the cakes, I will not move from this place, and then you shall have the money."

白言：「尊者！持鉢來。」  
He said, "Venerable! Bring the bowl."

即與鉢盛滿種種餅食，與已語言：「與我錢來。」  
He filled the bowl with various cakes and said, "Now give me the money."

答言：「汝自衣角頭解取。」  
He replied, "You can untie it from the corner of my robe."

肆上人欲調弄故不與解，語言：「汝自解與我。」  
The vendor, wanting to tease, did not untie it and said, "You untie it yourself and give it to me."

答言：「佛不聽我捉生色、似色，汝自解取。」  
He replied, "The Buddha does not allow me to handle raw materials or similar things; you untie it yourself."

解取已即呵責言：「云何沙門釋子，以少方便謂此為淨，我等亦不常以手捉及著口中，我亦不繫衣角頭及囊器中。此失沙門法，何道之有？」  
Upon untying it, the vendor reproached him, saying, "How is it that a renunciant, a son of the Śākyas, with such slight expedience declares this pure? We also do not usually touch or put it in our mouths by hand. We also do not tie it to a corner of a robe or into a pouch. This loses the ways of a renunciant, what path is there?"

時優陀夷持餅到自房中，喚餘比丘共食，諸比丘即問：「此餅甚好為何處得？此非家中作餅。」  
At that time, Udāyin carried the cakes back to his dwelling and called other monks to eat together. The monks immediately asked, "These cakes are very good, where did you get them? These are not household-made cakes."

答言：「諸長老！此中少利多過。」  
He replied, "Elders! There are few benefits in this, many faults."

諸比丘問言：「何故多過？」  
The monks asked, "Why are there many faults?"

答言：「我如是如是因緣是故多過。」  
He replied, "Because of such and such conditions, thus there are many faults."

諸比丘以是事具白世尊，佛言：「呼優陀夷來。」  
The monks reported these matters to the World-Honored One, who said, "Call Udāyin here."

來已，佛問優陀夷：「汝實爾不？」  
When he came, the Buddha asked Udāyin, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」  
He replied, "Yes, World-Honored One, it is true!"

佛言：「此是惡事，從今日後衣繫亦不聽。」  
The Buddha said, "This is a bad matter, from today forward it is also not allowed to tie money to the robe.


維羅衛城，廣說如上。
Again, the Buddha stayed in the city of Kapilavatthu and spoke extensively as before.

世尊以五事利益故，五日一行諸比丘房，見一比丘痿黃羸瘦，佛知而故問：「比丘忍苦不安隱住不？」
For the benefit of five matters, the Blessed One would visit the monks' quarters every five days, where he saw a monk who was feeble and emaciated. The Buddha knowingly asked, "Monk, do you endure suffering and reside in discomfort?"

答言：「世尊！我不安隱，疾病苦惱。」
He replied, "Blessed One! I am not at ease, I am afflicted with illness and suffering."

佛語比丘：「汝不能索隨病食、隨病藥耶？」
The Buddha said to the monk, "Can't you seek food or medicine that is suitable for your illness?"

答言：「我聞世尊制戒，不得自手捉生色、似色，復無人與我，是故受苦惱。」
He answered, "I heard the Blessed One's rules, which say I cannot personally handle raw or raw-looking food, and there is no one to assist me, hence I suffer."

佛言：「從今日後，聽病人得使淨人畜，莫貪著。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, the sick are allowed to make use of pure attendants; do not be attached."

佛告諸比丘：「依止迦維羅衛城比丘皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha instructed the monks, "Gather all the monks residing in the city of Kapilavatthu. For ten benefits, I establish a rule for the monks, so that even those who have already heard should hear again.

若比丘自手捉生色、似色，若使人捉舉，貪著者，尼薩耆波夜提。」
If a monk personally handles raw or raw-looking material, or makes someone else do it while being attached, there is an offense of expiation involving forfeiture."



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikshu, as mentioned above.




自手者，若身、若身分、若身相續。
One's own hand, whether the body, the parts of the body, or the continuation of the body.

身者，一切身。
As for the body, it refers to the entire body.

身分者，若手、若脚、若肘、若膝。
The parts of the body include the hands, feet, elbows, and knees.

身相續者，若繫僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會、覆瘡衣、僧祇枝、雨浴衣、若鉢、小鉢、鍵𨩲、銅盂中，如是比是名身相續。
The continuation of the body includes items like the monk's robe, upper garment, lower garment, covering garment, branch of the monk's staff, rain bathing garment, bowl, small bowl, key chain, and copper pot, and so forth, these are called the continuation of the body.




生色者，是金也。
Natural color is gold.

似色者，是銀。
Resembling color is silver.

生色似色者，錢等市用物。
Natural and resembling colors are things like money used in the market.




捉者，若自捉、若語人捉。
The catcher, whether catching himself, or telling others to catch.

舉者，若自舉、若教人舉。
The lifter, whether lifting himself, or instructing others to lift.




貪著者，作是念：「我當用此物得五欲，謂色、聲、香、味、觸等。」
The one who is attached thinks: "I shall use these things to obtain the five desires, namely sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches."

是名貪著。
This is called attachment.

不貪著者，如清淨持戒比丘，自擔糧食、麨糒、米麪等時，作是念：「我無有方便欲食此食，但於此不淨物中生清淨物想，我當受用。」
The one who is not attached, like a pure and disciplined monk, while carrying food, flour, rice, and other grains, thinks: "I have no intention to eat this food out of convenience, but I generate the thought of purity within these impure materials, and I will use them."

尼薩耆波夜提。
Nisaggiya Pācittiya.



尼薩耆波夜提者，是金銀錢應僧中捨，波夜提罪應悔過。
Nissaggiyapaññatti refers to the relinquishment of gold and silver money among the monks, requiring confession of a minor offense.

若不捨而悔，得越比尼罪。
If not relinquished and confessed, it leads to a pārājika offense.




此金銀、若錢，若作、不作、若多、若少、若純、若雜、若成器、不成器等，僧中捨已不得還，彼比丘僧亦不得分。若多者應著無盡物中。
These gold and silver, or money, whether made or not made, whether more or less, whether pure or mixed, whether formed or not, once abandoned by the monks, should not be taken back, and the monk members should not divide it. If there is much, it should be placed among the limitless things.

於此無盡物中，若生息利得作房舍中衣，不得食用。比丘凡得錢及安居訖，得衣直時不得自手取，當使淨人知。
Among these limitless things, if there are benefits gained from interest used for building and clothing, it should not be consumed. When a monk obtains money and after the residence period, when obtaining robes, one should not take it by oneself, and should make a layperson aware.

若無淨人，指示脚邊地語言：「是中知。」著地已，自得用草葉塼瓦等物遙擲覆上，待淨人來令知。
If there is no layperson, point to the ground at one's feet and say: "It is known here." Once placed on the ground, one can cover it remotely with grass, leaves, bricks, tiles, and other things, waiting for the layperson to come and know.

若淨人來，知已持去；若不可信者，教使在前行，使知置一處；若可信淨人者，從意使知置一處。
If the layperson comes and knows, they can take it away; if untrustworthy, instruct them to walk in front to know where it is placed; if the layperson is trustworthy, let them know as they wish where it is placed.

若比丘知佛事僧事，多有金銀錢當舉時，若是生地教淨人使知，若是覆處死土、若自掘，若使年少比丘掘。
If a monk knows of Buddhist or monastic affairs, with much gold or silver or money to be disposed of, if it is on fresh ground, instruct laypersons to know; if it is in covered dead ground, either dig oneself or have a younger monk dig.

若淨人不可信者，裹眼三旋，然後使知地。知地已，使知內錢坑中，猶復裹眼使去。
If the layperson is not trustworthy, blindfold them and spin them three times, then let them know the location. After knowing the location, let them know about the money in the pit, still blindfolding them when leaving.

若錢墮坑岸上者，得捉塼瓦擲錢使入坑中，得自填坑。後欲取時，若是生地使淨人知，若是死地得自掘，抒土到錢。
If money falls onto the side of the pit, one may take bricks or tiles to throw money into the pit, then fill the pit oneself. When later wishing to retrieve it, if it is fresh ground, let a layperson know; if it is dead ground, one can dig oneself to remove the soil to the money.

淨人不可信者，復裹眼三旋將來取之。若幞裹中有金銀錢，在橛上不得自捉，當使淨人知。
If the layperson is not trustworthy, blindfold them and spin them three times before bringing them to fetch it. If there is gold, silver or money wrapped in a package on a peg, one should not take it oneself but should inform a layperson.

若淨人小不及者，得抱舉使知取。抱時應作是言：「我舉淨人！我舉淨人！」得下物已，當使解。
If the layperson is too small to reach, carry them up to enable them to fetch it. When carrying, say: "I am lifting the layperson! I am lifting the layperson!" Once the item is lowered, let them undo it.

若不知解者，得捉淨人手教使解，解已教知數。若不知數者，得捉淨人手數。數已餘者，還教著囊中。
If they do not know how to undo it, hold the layperson’s hand to teach them to undo it, and after undoing, teach them to count. If they do not know how to count, hold the layperson's hand to count. Once counted, any remaining should be instructed to be placed back in the bag.

若不知著囊中者，得捉淨人手教著囊中。著囊中已，教淨人繫。若不知繫者，使淨人手捉囊底，比丘得自繫。
If they do not know how to put it in the bag, hold the layperson's hand to teach them to put it in the bag. Once in the bag, instruct the layperson to tie it. If they do not know how to tie it, have the layperson hold the bottom of the bag while the monk ties it himself.

繫已還置橛上，若淨人短不及者，得抱舉。若檻匱箱篋等在架上橛上，取時舉時覆時亦復如上。
After tying, place it back on the peg. If the layperson is too short to reach, lift them. If there is a chest, box, locker, etc., placed on a shelf or peg, during taking, lifting, and covering, do as described above.

若行道時淨人檐金銀，淨人若小得手牽去，若渡水時得抱渡，應作是言：「我渡淨人！我渡淨人！」
If during travel the layperson hangs up gold or silver, and if the layperson is small, they may take it by hand. When crossing water, it is permissible to carry the layperson across, saying: "I am crossing with the layperson! I am crossing with the layperson!"

若比丘將淨人行，若淨人小不能上船，得抱上。應作是言：「我舉淨人！我舉淨人！」下船時亦如是。
If a monk travels with a layperson, and if the layperson is small and cannot board the ship, they may be carried on. Say: "I am lifting the layperson! I am lifting the layperson!" The same applies when disembarking.

是比丘若道行食息時，若河、若井、若池上食。食已淨人忘囊去，有長老比丘，在後看諸人不忘物耶？
If the monk eats and rests during travel, whether by the river, well, or pond, and after eating, the layperson forgets their bag, a senior monk may stay behind to see if anyone has forgotten anything.

見有遺物，作是念：「此必是比丘許。」即便持去。行及伴已問伴言：「是誰許？」有人言：「此是淨人囊。」
Upon seeing an item left behind, they might think: "This must be the monk's permission." They then take it. When reaching a companion, they ask: "Whose permission is this?" Someone might say: "This is the layperson's bag."

即速放地，淨人爾時應即取去，不得字名。若比丘行道共淨人一處宿，夜發去時，淨人捉比丘幞。
Immediately, they should place it on the ground, and the layperson should take it immediately without a label. If a monk travels and stays overnight with a layperson, and when leaving at night, the layperson holds the monk's package.

比丘捉淨人幞，到地了見幞，是淨人幞，即應放地，淨人應取不得字名。
The monk holds the layperson's package, and upon reaching the ground, they see the package is the layperson's, they should immediately place it on the ground, and the layperson should take it without a label.



若比丘多有金銀錢失去，若疑在床間，欲求覓故，出床時，越比尼罪。
If a monk has lost a lot of gold and silver money, and suspects it to be in the bed, he desires to search for it, and while getting out of bed, he incurs an offense of negligence.

若得，尼薩耆。
If he finds it, he is free from negligence.

若比丘多有錢物，疑在氈褥中，欲求故出氈時，越比尼罪。
If a monk has much money and suspects it is in the mattress, he wants to search it so he takes out the mattress and thus incurs an offense of negligence.

得已，尼薩耆。
Having found it, he is free from negligence.

若比丘多有錢物，疑在地，欲求故掃地時，越比尼罪。
If a monk has much money and suspects it is on the ground, he desires to search for it by sweeping the ground and thus incurs an offense of negligence.

若得，尼薩耆。
If he finds it, he is free from negligence.

若比丘多有錢物，疑在糞掃中，欲求故出糞掃時，越比尼罪。
If a monk has much money and suspects it is in the garbage, he desires to search it by taking out the garbage and thus incurs an offense of negligence.

得，尼薩耆。
If he finds it, he is free from negligence.

若病比丘有人與藥直錢，病故得著敷褥底，眼闇求時，手摩觸在不？無罪。
If a sick monk is given medicine money and places it under the bedding due to illness, when he seeks for it with impaired vision and feels it with his hand, there is no offense.



若檀越新作金銀床机，信心故欲令比丘最初受用，比丘言：「我出家人法不得用。」
If a lay supporter makes a new gold or silver seat and wishes the monk to use it first due to faith, the monk says, "According to monastic rules, I cannot use it."

檀越復言：「尊者！為我故，頗有開通得受用不？」
The supporter further asks, "Venerable sir, on my behalf, is there any exception that allows you to use it?"

比丘應語言：「厚敷一一人，自重坐具者得坐。」
The monk should reply, "If a thick cover is placed, anyone who respects their own seat may sit on it."

比丘坐已不得動床，亦不得讚歎。
Once the monk sits, they should not move the seat nor praise it.

若檀越新作金銀承足机，信心故欲令比丘最初受用，比丘言：「我出家人法不得受用。」

應語言：「机上若著樹葉、若㲲覆上者得安脚。」
The monk should reply, "If leaves or cloth are placed on the stool, one may rest their feet on it."

安脚已不得動足，亦不得讚歎。
Once the feet are rested, one should not move their feet nor praise it.

有檀越作金銀盤，信心故欲令比丘最初受用，比丘言：「我出家人法不得用。」
If a lay supporter makes a gold or silver tray and wishes the monk to use it first due to faith, the monk says, "According to monastic rules, I cannot use it."

復言：「尊者！為我故，頗有方便開通得受用不？」
The supporter further asks, "Venerable sir, on my behalf, is there a convenient exception that allows you to use it?"

應語：「若草葉、若㲲覆盤上者得。」
The monk should reply, "If grass or cloth is placed on the tray, it may be used."

不得手捉，應指示著地。
It should not be held by hand; indicate by pointing to place it on the ground.

若檀越新作金銀器，信心故欲令比丘最初受用。
If a lay supporter makes a new gold or silver vessel and wishes the monk to use it first due to faith,

復言：「尊者！為我故，頗有方便開通得受用不？」
The supporter further asks, "Venerable sir, on my behalf, is there a convenient exception that allows you to use it?"

應語：「汝當淨洗置盤上持食來。」
The monk should reply, "You should wash it clean, place it on a tray, and bring the food."

來時應舒手指器，應作是言：「受！受！」
When it is brought, one should extend their hand, point to the vessel, and say, "Receive! Receive!" 

如是三說，名為受。
Saying this three times signifies acceptance.

受已，在器中食，不得觸器四邊。
Once accepted, one may eat from it, but must not touch the four edges of the vessel.



若四月八日及大會供養時，金銀塔菩薩像，及幢幡蓋供養具，一切有金銀塗者，比丘不得自手捉，使淨人捉。
On April 8th and during grand offerings, when dealing with gold or silver-gilded pagodas, Bodhisattva statues, banners, or offering items, monks should not handle them with their own hands but should have lay people do it.

國土所不用、相不成就，作銅鐵捉，無罪。
No offense is incurred for handling copper or iron, which are not regarded as currency.

是故說。
Therefore, it is stated.



，廣說如上。  
The Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti, teaching extensively as above.

時六群比丘在市中，買酥油、蜜、石蜜、乳酪、魚肉，種種買食，為世人所嫌：「云何沙門釋子不能乞食，到諸市中買食而食？失沙門法，何道之有？」  
At that time, six groups of monks went to the market to buy ghee, honey, rock honey, cheese, fish, and meat, various kinds of food, which were criticized by people: "How can the ascetic followers of Shakyamuni not beg for alms but buy food in the market? They lose the practice of the monks, what path is this?"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」  
The monks, for this reason, went to report to the Blessed One, and the Buddha said: "Call the six groups of monks to come."

來已，佛問六群比丘：「汝實市中種種買食，為世人所嫌耶？」  
Upon their arrival, the Buddha asked the six groups of monks: "Do you indeed buy various foods in the market and are criticized by people?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」  
They replied: "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「此是惡事，正應為世人所嫌。汝常不聞我讚歎少欲、呵責多欲耶？  
The Buddha said: "This is a bad act, and rightfully criticized by people. Have you not often heard me praise the desire for little and reproach the desire for much?

此非法、非律、不如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」  
This is not the Dharma, not the discipline, unlike the Buddha's teachings, and cannot nurture good qualities."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城比丘皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。若比丘種種買賣，尼薩耆波夜提。」  
The Buddha told the monks: "All the monks residing in the city of Shravasti must gather, for the sake of ten benefits, to establish rules for the monks, so that those who have heard will hear again. If a monk engages in various buying and selling, it is a transgression of the rule."




比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as stated above.




種種者，若自問價、若使人問價；
For various reasons, one may ask the price themselves or have someone else ask it;

若自上價、若使人上價；
Whether one raises the price themselves or has someone else raise it;

若自下價、若使人下價。
Whether one lowers the price themselves or has someone else lower it.

問價者，「此物直幾許？」
The one asking the price says, "How much is this item?"

答言：「爾許與汝，爾許取不？」
The response is, "I offer this amount to you, would you take it?"

作不淨問故，越比尼罪。
Due to asking improperly, it violates the Vinaya rule.

得者，尼薩耆。
The result is a Nissaggiya offense.

使人問者，語言：「汝往問：『彼物索幾許？』
Having someone else ask, saying: "Go and ask, 'How much is that item asking for?'

若言：『索爾許。』者，汝便與爾所。」
If it's said, 'Asking for this much,' then offer that much."

作不淨語，遣人問故，越比尼罪。
Due to improper speech and sending someone to ask, it violates the Vinaya rule.

得者，尼薩耆。
The result is a Nissaggiya offense.

上價者，「此價直幾許？」
The one raising the price may ask, "How much is the worth of this price?"

答言：「爾許與汝。爾許欲取故諍上價。」
The response may be, "I offer this to you, wanting you to debate for a higher price."

作不淨語故，越比尼罪。
Due to using improper speech, it violates the Vinaya rule.

得者，尼薩耆。
The result is a Nissaggiya offense.

使人上者，語前人言：「汝往上爾許。爾許得者取。」
Having someone else raise the price, telling the previous person: "You go and offer this much; if accepted, take it."

是名不淨。
This is called impure.

遣使語，越比尼罪。
Sending a messenger with these words violates the Vinaya rule.

得者，尼薩耆。
The result is a Nissaggiya offense.

下者，「此價直幾？」
If lowering, "How much is this price worth?"

答言：「一千。」「我與汝八百。」
The response might be, "A thousand." "I'll give you eight hundred."

若言：「九百。」語言：「我與汝七百。」
If it is said, "Nine hundred." He says: "I'll give you seven hundred."

如是至十，下求他物不淨語故，越比尼罪。
Thus it goes on to ten, lowering to seek other things with improper speech, violating the Vinaya rule.

得者，尼薩耆。
The result is a Nissaggiya offense.

使人下者，亦如是。
Sending others to lower is the same.

若以時物還買時物，買夜分物、買七日物、買終身物、買隨身物、買重物、買不淨物、買淨不淨物。
If one trades temporary items for temporary ones, buys items for the night, buys seven-day items, buys lifetime items, buys required items, buys impure items, buys pure-impure items.

語時，犯越比尼罪。
In speaking, it violates the Vinaya rule.

得者，尼薩耆。
The result is a Nissaggiya offense.

如是夜分、七日、終身、隨身物，重物、淨不淨物，各各作問亦如是。
For such night items, seven-day items, lifetime items, personal items, heavy items, pure-impure items, the questioning for each is also like this.



尼薩耆波夜提者，如上說。  
Niraya Pati is described as above.




肆上衣先已有定價，比丘持價來買衣，置地時應語物主言：「此直知是衣。」

The cloth is already priced, and when a monk brings payment to buy the cloth, when placing it on the ground, he should say to the owner, "This is the price for the cloth."

若不語默然持去者，犯越比尼罪。

If he does not say this and takes it silently, it is a breach of the monastic rules.

買傘蓋箱、革屣、扇篋、甘蔗、魚脯、酥酪、油蜜種種，亦如是。

The same applies to buying umbrellas, leather shoes, fans, sugarcanes, dried fish, butter, oils, and honey.

有國土市買有常法，齎直來著物邊，賣物主搖頭，當知相與，比丘亦應語言：「此直知是物。」

In regions with established market customs, when payment is brought and placed by the item, if the seller agrees with a nod, the monk should also say, "This is the price for the item."

前人若解、不解，要應作是語。

Whether or not the previous person comprehends, this phrase should still be said.

若不作是語，默然持物去者，犯越比尼罪。

If he does not speak this phrase and takes the item silently, it is a breach of the monastic rules.

若估客賣物應直五十而索百錢，比丘言：「我以五十。」

If a merchant demands one hundred coins for an item worth fifty, the monk should say, "I will pay fifty."

知是如是求者，不名為下。

Understanding the value as fair is not considered degrading.

若比丘知前人欲買物，不得抄市，應問言：「汝止未？」

If a monk knows someone else intends to buy an item, he must not intervene, and should ask, "Are you finished?"

若言：「未，我方堅價。」比丘爾時不得中間抄買。

買者，犯越比尼罪。

To buy in this situation is a breach of the monastic rules.

若言：「我休。」當語物主言：「我以此價知是物。」

If the response is, "I am done," he should tell the owner, "I offer this price for the item."

賣鉢時，作是念：「此鉢好，至某方當得利。」買時，犯越比尼罪。

If a monk sees someone selling a bowl and thinks, "This bowl is good, I can profit from it somewhere," purchasing it would be a transgression of the Vinaya.

若作是念：「我有是物，無有淨人，此是淨物。」得買去，無罪。

If he thinks, "I have this item, and there is no pure person here, this item is pure," and buys it, it is not a sin.

到某方或和尚阿闍梨所須，或自為病、或作功德，買去本不為利，臨時得貴價賣，無罪。

If, when reaching a place, an abbot or teacher needs it, or for his own illness or for merit-making he buys not intending profit, but at that time it is sold at a high price, there is no sin.

如是一切物，若比丘糴穀時，作是念：「此後當貴。」糴時，犯越毘尼罪。

In all such matters, if a monk buys grain thinking, "It will be expensive later," he commits a transgression of the Vinaya upon buying.

糶時，尼薩耆。

When selling, it is considered a Nissaggiya offense.

若作是念：「恐某時穀貴，我今糴此穀。我當依是得誦經坐禪行道。到時穀大貴，若食長、若與和尚阿闍梨、若作功德。」餘者糶得利，無罪。

If he thinks, "I'm worried grain will be expensive later, I'll buy now so I can recite sutras, meditate, and walk the path. If at that time grain becomes very expensive, whether to extend food, give to abbot or teacher, or for meritorious deeds," the rest is sold at profit without sin.

若比丘儲藥草時作是念：「此後當貴。」買時，犯越比尼罪。

應當語言：「以此價知是。」

One should say, "Taking this price, I know this."

If a monk with long flakes of barley at a stall buys ghee or cheese and speaks impure words, it is a Vinaya transgression.

得者，尼薩耆波夜提。

Obtaining such, it is a Nissaggiya Pācittiya.

比丘不得至人閙處店肆上市買，得到邊少人肆上，言以此價知是。

Monks should not go to crowded places or stalls for purchases; they should reach less crowded areas and say, "With this price, I know this."

如是一切盡皆應言知。

This, in all cases, one should know and say


若乞食比丘有殘麨，雇治革屣，作不淨語，犯越比尼罪。

有檀越為比丘故，與店上錢，語言：「若某比丘日日來有所索，從意與彼比丘。」

A lay supporter, for the sake of the monk, gives money to the shop, saying: "If a certain monk comes daily asking for something, provide from your store to that monk."

後來索時作淨不淨語，無罪。

Later, when asking, speaking in pure or impure terms, there is no offense.

是比丘所索物，店上無，即與比丘錢餘處買，比丘往至餘處，求物時作不淨語得者，尼薩耆波夜提。

If the item requested by the monk is not in the shop, and money is given to the monk to buy elsewhere, and the monk uses impure speech to obtain the item, it is an offense entailing expiation.

若比丘店肆上不淨語分別價、淨語取，淨語分別價、不淨語取，不淨語分別價、不淨語取，淨語分別價、淨語取。

If a monk at a shop uses impure speech to discuss the price but takes it with pure speech, uses pure speech to discuss the price but takes it with impure speech, uses impure speech both to discuss the price and take, uses pure speech both to discuss the price and take.

不淨語分別價、淨語取者，問前人：「此物賣索幾許？我欲知此物。」

是故說。

Thus it is said.




大林重閣精舍，廣說如上。
The Buddha stayed at the Great Forest Monastery in Vesali with many stories, and taught extensively as mentioned above.

時難陀、優波難陀從王家買金，使王家金銀師作瓔珞嚴飾之具。
At that time, Nanda and Upananda bought gold from the royal family and had it crafted into ornaments by the royal jeweler.

作成已瑩治發光，盛著箱中菁㲲蓮花覆上，與沙彌，先教言：「我將汝到貴勝家，若語汝開時，汝但開現一角頭。」
After the ornaments were polished and shone, they were placed in a box covered with a fine lotus cloth. Given to a novice, they were instructed: "I will take you to a noble's house, and when they ask you to open the box, only reveal one corner."

即將至貴勝家。
He then took it to the noble's house.

貴勝家婦女見來，頭面禮足，却住一面即問言：「此箱中是何等？」
The household women saw them arrive, bowed, and then asked: "What is in this box?"

答言：「用問此為？非汝所問。」
He replied, "Why do you ask? It is not for you to inquire."

以不示故復更慇懃，語沙彌言：「出示與看。」
Because it wasn't revealed, they became more earnest and told the novice, "Show us."

沙彌即示一角，菁助發色，日光照金晃昱耀目，問言：「尊者！此是誰許？」
The novice revealed a corner; the fine cloth enhanced the colors, and the sunlight made the gold sparkle, dazzling the eyes. They asked, "Venerable one! Whose is this?"

答言：「用問此為？有金有作者，即是其主。」
He answered, "Why ask? Whoever owns the gold and had it crafted, they are the owner."

復問：「金價直幾？作功用幾？」
They asked again, "How much does the gold cost? How much for the craftsmanship?"

即如實答：「金直爾許，功夫爾所。」
He answered truthfully, "The gold costs this much, the craftsmanship that much."

即言：「大貴。」
They said, "Very expensive."

「汝云何嫌貴？我與汝爾許直，汝能作不？」
"Why do you say it's expensive? If I give you this much, can you make it?"

中有直信者，作是言：「誠如師教，作亦甚難，非可卒得。」
Among them, a sincere one said, "Truly, as the teacher says, it's very difficult to make; it cannot be done hastily."

中有婦人，或自有財、或父母財、或姑嫜財、或伯叔財、或夫婿財、或家中密取財，持買瓔珞。
There were women who either had their own wealth, or their parents', or in-laws', or uncles' and aunts', or husbands' wealth, or secretly took wealth from the house to buy the ornaments.

時人不復肆上買金，亦不雇金銀師作。
Then people no longer went to market to buy gold, nor hired goldsmiths.

時諸肆上人及金銀師，皆嫌言：「云何沙門釋子奪人息利？」
The market people and goldsmiths all complained, "How can the ascetic sons of the Shakyans take our livelihoods?"

諸比丘即以是事，往白世尊，
The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「喚難陀、優波難陀來。」
The Buddha said, "Call Nanda and Upananda here."

來已，佛問難陀、優波難陀：「汝實從王家買金，使金師作不？」
When they came, the Buddha asked Nanda and Upananda, "Did you actually buy gold from the royal family and have it crafted?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
They answered, "Indeed, Blessed One!"

佛言：「優波難陀！此是惡事。汝常不聞我無數方便呵責多欲、讚歎少欲？」
The Buddha said, "Upananda! This is a bad deed. Have you not often heard me criticize greed and praise modest desires?"

此非法、非律、不如佛教，不可以是長養善法。
This is neither lawful, nor in accordance with the Dharma, and it does not nurture virtue.

佛告諸比丘：「依止毘舍離比丘盡集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all the monks residing around Vesali, for the benefit of ten reasons, I've established a rule for the monks. Even those who have heard it should hear it again."

若比丘種種販賣生色、似色，尼薩耆波夜提。
If a monk engages in various trades of colors or similar, it constitutes a Nisagiya Pacittiya offense.


比丘者，如上說。
Monks, as mentioned above.

Gold silver collaborative door twelve four propositions, elaborated as above.

是故說。

Therefore, it is said.

第二跋渠竟。

The second exposition ends.



，廣說如上。

The Buddha stayed in Śrāvastī and taught extensively as mentioned above.

時有瓦師字法豫，有比丘到時，著入聚落衣往到其家。

At that time, there was a potter named Fayu. When a monk arrived, he put on village clothes and went to his house.

法豫見已，頭面禮足，却住一面。

Seeing him, Fayu bowed his head to the monk's feet and then stood aside.

比丘言：「我須鉢。」

The monk said, "I need a bowl."

即作鉢持與，不大不小，適得其中燒熟滑澤。

Fayu immediately made a bowl, just the right size, fired and polished, and gave it to the monk.

即持還到祇洹，諸比丘問：「長老何處得此鉢，不大不小，適得其中燒熟滑澤？」

The monk took it back to Jetavana, where the other monks asked, "Elder, where did you get this bowl, perfectly sized, well-fired, and polished?"

答言：「瓦師法豫施我。」

He replied, "The potter Fayu gave it to me."

諸比丘聞已，復往索盡得，如是眾多。

When the monks heard this, they went to him and received bowls until there were many.

法豫作是念：「諸比丘多有須鉢，我不如請眾僧與鉢。」

Fayu thought, "Since many monks need bowls, I should invite the entire sangha and offer bowls to them."

眾僧者是良福田，果報無量。」

"The sangha is a fertile field of merits, bringing immeasurable rewards."

即往至祇洹精舍上座前，頭面禮足，䠒跪合掌，白言：

He then went to the senior monks at Jetavana, bowed, knelt down with palms joined, and said:

「我瓦師法豫，請大德眾僧施鉢，須者來取。」

"I, the potter Fayu, invite the illustrious sangha to receive bowls; let those who need them come and take them."

時比丘或取一、或取二、三、四，乃至十，法豫作不供。

At that time, the monks would take one, two, three, four, or even up to ten each, and Fayu could not keep up.

時尊者舍利弗時到著入聚落衣，持鉢入舍衛城，次行乞食往到其家。

Then Venerable Śāriputra, wearing his village clothes and carrying a bowl, entered Śrāvastī and came to his house while seeking alms.

其家婦人信心歡喜，淨洗銅器盛食出到著鉢中。

The woman of the house, with joyous faith, cleansed a copper vessel and filled it with food, placing it in his bowl.

其婦先識尊者舍利弗，頭面禮足，却住一面。

The woman, who previously knew Venerable Śāriputra, bowed at his feet and then stood aside.

尊者舍利弗問言：「家中生業何似？」

Venerable Śāriputra asked, "How is the livelihood in your home?"

答言：「家中生業不舉。」

She replied, "The livelihood at home is not prospering."

問言：「何故？」

He asked, "Why?"

答言：「我家夫主請僧與鉢，諸比丘或取一、二，乃至十，作鉢不供，家業不辦。」

She answered, "My husband invited the monastics and gave them bowls. Some monks took one or two, up to ten each; we can't keep up with the production, and the household affairs are neglected."

何以故？我家仰是瓦作生活，大小飲食衣服、供王賦稅。

"Why? Because our family relies on pottery for our living, for our food, clothing, and taxes."

阿闍梨是我家供養尊重故說是語耳！」

"Venerable, I speak this out of respect for you, whom our family supports!"

時舍利弗廣為說法，生歡喜心已而去。

At that time, Śāriputra extensively taught the Dharma, generated joy in the heart, and then left.

時尊者舍利弗以是因緣往白世尊，

Then Venerable Śāriputra reported this matter to the Blessed One,

佛言：「呼是比丘來。」

The Buddha said, "Call those monks here."

即呼來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」

They were called, and the Buddha asked the monks, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」

They replied, "Indeed, Blessed One!"

佛語諸比丘：「施主不知籌量，受者應籌量。」

The Buddha said to the monks, "The donors may not know how to measure, but the recipients should know."

佛言：「從今日比丘長鉢聽一日畜。」

The Buddha said, "From today on, monks may keep large bowls for only one day.


復次佛住毘舍離，大林重閣精舍，廣說如上。
Furthermore, the Buddha stayed in Vaishali, at the Great Forest Monastery, and elaborated as above.

毘舍離人年年請僧食，食已施鉢。
The people of Vaishali invited the monks for meals annually, and after eating, they offered bowls.

時比丘不受用此鉢：「為世尊聽我長鉢正得一日畜，未得受用，便成不淨。」
At that time, the monks did not use these bowls, saying, "The Buddha allowed us to keep large bowls for one day only; without permission, using them would become impure."

時施主言：「我當從世尊乞是願。」
The donor said, "I shall seek this permission from the Buddha."

施主到世尊所，頭面禮足，却住一面白佛言：「世尊！我等年年請僧食，食已施鉢。」
The donor approached the Buddha, respectfully paid homage, and said, "World-Honored One, we invite the monks for meals annually and then offer bowls.

諸比丘不受，作是言：『我用此鉢為？未得受用，便成不淨。』
The monks are not accepting them, saying, 'What use have we for these bowls? Without permission, using them would become impure.'

善哉世尊！頗有因緣得開通，令施者得功德，受者得利不？」
Great Buddha! Is there a reason for exemptions to be made, so that donors gain merit and recipients benefit?"

佛言：「聽先一日，更與九日。」
The Buddha said, "Permission is granted for an initial day, with an extension of nine more days."

時諸比丘畜鉢滿十日，持鉢往至世尊所，白言：「此鉢滿十日，今當云何？」
The monks kept the bowls for ten days, then took them to the Buddha and said, "These bowls have been kept for ten days, what should we do now?"

佛言：「諸比丘！此鉢應知識比丘邊作淨，若十日裏捨故受新，十日一易。」
The Buddha said, "Monks, these bowls should be purified by knowledgeable monks. If forsaken within ten days and replaced, it should be exchanged every ten days."

佛告諸比丘：「依止毘舍離比丘皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "All monks residing in Vaishali should assemble. In consideration of ten benefits, a rule is established for all monks, and those who have heard it should listen again."

若比丘長鉢得畜十日。若過者，尼薩耆波夜提。
If a monk keeps a large bowl for more than ten days, it results in an offense of expiation involving forfeiture.



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as mentioned above.




十日者，得畜齊十日。
In ten days, you can obtain and domesticate for ten days.




長鉢者，受持外鉢也。  
The long bowl is used for holding the outer bowl.  




鉢者，一、參婆鉢；二、烏迦斯魔鉢；三、優迦吒耶鉢；四、多祇耶鉢；五、鐵鉢；六、緻葉尼鉢；七、畢荔偷鉢。
The types of bowls are: 1. Sambhāpa bowl; 2. Ukāsmo bowl; 3. Uḥkāṭaya bowl; 4. Dāgaya bowl; 5. Iron bowl; 6. Chĩyāni bowl; 7. Bilito bowl.

上鉢、中鉢、下鉢、過鉢、非鉢、隨鉢。
There are upper bowls, middle bowls, lower bowls, excessive bowls, non-bowls, and random bowls.

上者，摩竭提國一阿羅米作飯及受羹菜，一阿羅者可此間斗六升。
The upper bowl refers to rice made with one āra of grain in Magadha country, which can hold six dǒu.

中者，半阿羅米作飯及受羹菜。
The middle bowl refers to rice made with half an āra of grain.

下者，一鉢他米作飯及受羹菜，三分飯一分羹菜。
The lower bowl refers to rice made with one pāta of grain and takes three parts of rice to one part of broth.

過鉢者，煮一阿羅米飯，并羹菜不滿，是名過鉢。
The excessive bowl refers to cooking rice with one āra of grain, where the broth and greens are not full.

非鉢者，不受一鉢他米飯并羹菜，是名非鉢。
The non-bowl refers to not receiving rice and broth made with one pāta of grain.

隨鉢者，隨鉢中所用器，此中上鉢、中鉢、下鉢畜過十日，尼薩耆波夜提。
The random bowl refers to containers used at random, which hold for more than ten days, leading to Nisagiya Pacittiya.

餘者，不犯。
Others are not violations.



尼薩耆波夜提者，是鉢應僧中捨，波夜提罪應悔過。
Nisaggiya Pācittiya refers to items that should be relinquished among the assembly, and the Pācittiya offense should be confessed.

若不捨而悔，得越比尼罪。
If one does not relinquish and only confesses, it becomes a transgression of the Vinaya rules.

波夜提者，如上說。
"Pācittiya" is as described above.

若比丘月生一日得十鉢畜不作淨，過十日，一切尼薩耆波夜提。
If a monk acquires ten alms bowls on the first day of the lunar month without purifying them, after ten days, it constitutes a Nisaggiya Pācittiya offense for each.

乃至不曉受持、不曉作淨，當教如是受持、如是作淨，皆如第一長衣戒中說，此中但以鉢為異，是故說。
For those who do not know how to accept and purify them, they should be instructed on how to accept and purify them, as stated in the first long cloth rule, except in this case it is about bowls, hence it is stated.



，廣說如上。

Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti, teaching extensively as mentioned above.

時舍衛城中瓦師法豫，請僧施鉢，諸比丘為好故，持故鉢來易新鉢者，如是眾多遂不相供。

At that time, in the city of Shravasti, a potter named Fayü invited the monks to offer bowls. Many monks exchanged their old bowls for new ones, and consequently, they did not support each other.

爾時尊者舍利弗到時，著入聚落衣持鉢入城，次行乞食到法豫門前住。

At that time, the venerable Śāriputra arrived, donned his robes, carried his bowl, and entered the city to beg for alms, stopping at Fayü's door.

法豫婦與尊者舍利弗舊是相識，信心歡喜，乃至言：「尊者！我家夫主請僧與鉢，諸比丘為好故，持故鉢來易新者。

Fayü's wife was an old acquaintance of the venerable Śāriputra. She was full of faith and joy, expressing, “Venerable sir! My husband invites monks to offer bowls, but many monks exchange their old bowls for new ones.

我家中積聚故鉢成聚如山，我俗人家新鉢尚不用，何況故者？

Our house has accumulated a pile of used bowls as high as a mountain. We laypeople don't even use new bowls, let alone old ones.

尊者！我家仰瓦作生活。」乃至舍利弗為隨順說法，發歡喜心已，禮足而退。

Venerable sir! Our family depends on pottery for our livelihood." Śāriputra then expounded the Dharma in accord with the situation, inspiring joy and departed after paying respects.

舍利弗還到精舍，以是因緣具白世尊，佛言：「呼此比丘來。」

Śāriputra returned to the monastery and reported the matter to the Blessed One. The Buddha said, “Call those monks here.”

來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」

When they arrived, the Buddha asked the monks, “Is this true?” They replied, “Indeed, Blessed One!”

佛言：「從今日後不聽比丘索鉢。」

The Buddha said, “From this day forward, monks are not allowed to request bowls.”


衛城，廣說如上。  
Furthermore, the Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti and extensively preached as above.

北方有六十比丘來欲禮拜世尊，於道中被賊失鉢，無鉢入祇洹精舍。  
Sixty monks from the north came wanting to pay respects to the Blessed One and lost their bowls to robbers on the way; they entered Jivaka's monastery without bowls.

爾時諸梵行者各各與鉢，得鉢已往到世尊所，頭面禮足，却住一面。  
At that time, various celibate practitioners each gave them a bowl, and having obtained bowls, they proceeded to the Blessed One, bowed their heads at his feet, and stood to one side.

佛知而故問：「諸比丘汝從何處來？」  
The Buddha, knowing, purposely asked, "Monks, where have you come from?"

答言：「北方來。」  
They replied, "We have come from the north."

佛問比丘：「道路安隱不？」  
The Buddha asked the monks, "Was your journey safe?"

答言：「不安隱，道路被賊失鉢，無鉢入祇洹，諸梵行者各各與我鉢。」  
They replied, "It was not safe; on the road, robbers took our bowls, and we entered Jivaka without bowls. The celibate practitioners each gave us a bowl."

佛問諸比丘：「道中無有聚落城邑耶？」  
The Buddha asked the monks, "Were there no villages or towns along the way?"

答言：「有。」  
They replied, "There were."

問言：「何故不乞？」  
Asked, "Why did you not beg?"

答言：「我聞世尊制戒不聽乞鉢，復無施者。」  
They replied, "We heard the Blessed One made a rule forbidding asking for bowls, and there were no donors."

佛言：「善哉，善哉！比丘！汝等信心出家，法正應爾，乃至失命不故犯戒，從今日聽失鉢時乞。」  
The Buddha said, "Well done, well done, monks! You have left home with faith, and this is proper conduct, even to the point of losing your life without intentionally breaking precepts. From today, you are allowed to beg when you lose your bowls.


復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
At another time, the Buddha was staying in Shravasti and spoke extensively as before.

時北方六十失鉢比丘來到祇桓，尊者難陀、優波難陀語言：「長老！世尊聽失鉢得乞，何故不乞？」
At that time, sixty monks from the north who had lost their alms bowls came to Jetavana, and the venerable Nanda and Upananda said, "Elder! The Blessed One allows those who have lost their bowls to beg, why don't you beg?"

答言：「諸梵行人已與我鉢。」
The answer was: "The other Brahmacharis have already given me a bowl."

復言：「汝若不乞所應得者，便失此利。」
They further said, "If you don't beg for what you deserve, you will lose this benefit."

答言：「我已得鉢，失以不失無在。」
The answer was, "I have already gotten the bowl, losing it or not has no significance."

難陀言：「我當為汝乞。」
Nanda said, "I will beg for you."

答言：「汝自當知。」
The response was, "You should know yourself."

乃至優婆塞言：「尊者欲作瓦肆耶？」
Until the Upasaka said, "Venerable one, do you wish to become a tile maker?"

如乞衣中廣說。
Extensively explained as in the request for robes.

諸比丘聞已往白世尊，佛言：「呼難陀、優波難陀來。」
The monks heard this and went to report to the Blessed One, and the Buddha said, "Call Nanda and Upananda here."

來已，佛問難陀、優波難陀：「汝實爾不？」
When they came, the Buddha asked Nanda and Upananda, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
They replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「何故乞耶？」
The Buddha said, "Why do you beg?"

答言：「我為失鉢比丘乞。」
They replied, "I beg for the monks who lost their bowls."

佛言：「呼失鉢比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the monks who lost their bowls here."

來已，佛問比丘：「汝使難陀、優波難陀乞鉢耶？」
When they came, the Buddha asked the monks, "Did you have Nanda and Upananda beg for bowls?"

答言：「不也。世尊！」
They replied, "No, Blessed One!"

佛言：「何因緣乞？」
The Buddha said, "What is the reason for begging?"

答言：「如是……如是……。」
The reply was, "Thus... thus..."

佛語諸比丘：「是難陀、優波難陀不應乞者便乞，應乞者不乞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Nanda and Upananda beg when they shouldn't, and don't beg when they should."

佛語難陀、優波難陀：「此是惡事。汝常不聞我以無數方便，讚歎少欲、毀呰多欲？」
The Buddha said to Nanda and Upananda, "This is a bad thing. Have you not often heard me extolling the virtues of having few desires and condemning greed with countless expediencies?"

此非法、非律、不如佛教，不可以是長養善法。
This is not the Dharma, not the discipline, not according to the Buddha's teachings, and cannot be used to cultivate good dharma.

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城者盡集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "All those residing in Shravasti should gather; for the sake of ten benefits, I will lay down a precept for the monks. Those who have already heard it should hear it again."

若比丘所用鉢減五綴，更乞新鉢，為好故，尼薩耆波夜提。
If a monk uses a bowl with fewer than five patches and asks for a new one for the sake of beauty, it is nissaggiya pacittiya (a disciplinary offense).

是鉢應僧中捨，比丘眾中最下鉢應與，應如是教：「汝比丘受是鉢，乃至破，是事法爾。」
The bowl should be relinquished among the Sangha, and the most inferior bowl among the monks should be given, with the instruction, "You, monk, accept this bowl until it breaks; this is the natural order of things."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikshu is as described above.




減五綴者，若有一綴量，減五是名減；
If there is one knot, reducing it by five is called reduction;

若有二綴乃至有五綴量，減五是名減。
If there are two up to five knots, reducing by five is still called reduction.

滿五綴者，已有五綴量亦滿，是名滿。
Having five knots is already considered full, and this is called fulfillment.

若四、三、二、一綴，若無綴量，滿五是名滿。
If there are four, three, two, one, or no knots, reaching five is called fulfillment.

五綴量者，破處綴間相去足一大指。
The measurement of five knots means the distance between breaks is sufficient for one thumb length.



鉢者，如上說。
The bowl, as stated above.




新者，初成。
Something newly created or formed.




若乞、若勸化。

Begging, or persuading.




嫌太大、太小、太重、太輕、若麁澁。
For the sake of quality, it is considered too big, too small, too heavy, too light, or too rough.

我有檀越，有泥有手力，當更作好鉢。
I have donors, clay, and skill, and I should make a better bowl.

是比丘應持是新鉢，眾僧中捨，眾僧中選下鉢應與是比丘，應如是教：「汝長老受此鉢，乃至破。」
This monk should hold this new bowl, relinquish it among the congregation, and let the congregation choose a lesser bowl to give to this monk, and thus instruct: "You, elder, accept this bowl until it breaks."

不得故打破，波夜提悔過。
Do not deliberately break it; the offense requires confession.

是新鉢應眾僧中捨，波夜提罪應悔過。
This new bowl should be relinquished among the congregation, and the offense of breaking it requires confession.

若不捨而悔，犯越比尼罪。
If one does not relinquish but confesses, it is a transgression offense.

波夜提者，如上說。
Confession, as stated above.



是比丘鉢減五綴為好故，更求新者，尼薩耆。
For the reason that the monk's bowl lost five patches and seems good, he seeks a new one, which is wrongful.

是比丘應請持律知羯磨者，乃至五法成就僧當羯磨作行鉢人。
Such a monk should invite one who knows the rules of conduct and until a monk achieves the five methods, he becomes the one for the ceremonial bowl.

何等五？
What are the five?

不愛、不瞋、不怖、不癡、與不與知，是名五。
Not fondness, not hatred, not fear, not ignorance, and whether to give or not to give, these are the five.

羯磨人應作是說：「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，若僧時到，僧差某甲比丘作行鉢人，如是白。」
The one conducting the ceremony should say: "Great noble monk, listen! This monk [name] achieves five methods, if the time for the monk comes, the monk entrusts [name] to be the bowl bearer, he thus declares."

「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，僧今差某甲比丘作行鉢人。諸大德忍某甲比丘作行鉢人，忍者僧默然，若不忍便說。」
"Great noble monk, listen! This monk [name] achieves five methods, the monk now appoints this monk [name] to be the bowl bearer. The great noble monks tolerate this monk [name] as the bowl bearer, if accepting, the monk remains silent, if not, they speak."

「僧已忍使某甲比丘作行鉢人竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
"The monks already tolerate deploying this monk [name] as the bowl bearer, therefore the monks remain silent, thus completing this task."

作羯磨訖，應僧中唱：「大德僧所受持鉢，一切持來。」
After finishing the ceremony, announce among the monks: "The monk’s accepted and held bowls should all be brought here."

若不唱者，犯越毘尼罪。
If not announced, it constitutes a transgression against the Vinaya.

諸比丘應各各齎己所受持鉢來，若有比丘捨先所受鉢，更受下鉢持來者，得越比尼罪。
Each monk should bring the bowl they have accepted and held, if any monk abandons their previously accepted bowl and takes another inferior one, it constitutes a transgression against the Vinaya.

羯磨人應當語此比丘捨此鉢。
The one conducting the ceremony should tell this monk to abandon this bowl.

偏袒右肩，右膝著地言：「我某甲比丘鉢減五綴，為好故，更求新鉢，我今僧中捨。」
Uncover the right shoulder, kneel the right knee on the ground, and say: "I, monk [name], the bowl has lost five patches, for good reason, seek a new bowl, now abandoned in the monks’ community."

律師應問：「汝受用未？」
The legal expert should ask: "Have you used it?"

若言：「受用。」應語言：「此中用不淨鉢，得無量越比尼罪。應懺悔。」
If they say: "Used it." He should say: "Using this unclean bowl here constitutes countless transgressions against the Vinaya. It should be confessed."

應言：「長老！我某甲鉢減五綴，更乞新鉢，已僧中捨。」
He should say: "Elder! I, monk [name], the bowl has lost five patches, I further plead for a new bowl, already abandoned in the monks’ community."

此中犯波夜提。
Herein, he commits Pārājika.

受用不淨鉢，犯無量越比尼罪，一切悔過。
Using an unclean bowl constitutes countless transgressions against the Vinaya, all should be confessed.

問：「汝見罪不？」
Asked: "Do you see the sin?"

答言：「見。」
Answer: "I see it."

「謹慎莫復犯。」
"Be careful not to commit it again."

答言：「頂戴持。」
Answer: "I uphold it."

行鉢人應持此鉢與僧上座，上座若取，應持上座鉢與第二上座，如是次第，乃至無歲比丘。
The bowl bearer should give this bowl to the senior monk, if the senior takes it, should give the senior’s bowl to the second senior, in this order, until no aged monk remains.

若都無人取者，應還本主。
If no one takes it, it should be returned to the original owner.

若是鉢大貴者，應賣取十鉢直，九鉢直入僧淨厨，一鉢還本主。
If the bowl is very expensive, sell it to gain the value of ten bowls, nine bowl values go to the monks’ pure kitchen, and one bowl returns to the original owner.

應語言：「汝持此鉢，乃至破是持綴鉢。」
Say: "You hold this bowl, until it breaks, use it as a patched bowl."

比丘入聚落，乞食食已，應解綴。
The monk enters the village, after begging for food and eating, should undo the patches.

若灰若土淨洗，洗時不得持堅物刺孔中令破，當以鳥翮刺中。
Whether with ashes or soil, clean wash, while washing do not use hard objects to pierce holes to cause damage, should use bird quills to pierce.

洗鉢時，不得以沙灰洗令脫色，當用無沙巨摩根汁、葉汁、花汁、果汁洗。
When washing the bowl, do not use sand and ashes to cause color stripping, should use Kaempheria galanga root juice, leaf juice, flower juice, fruit juice to wash.

洗時不得臨坑岸上危險處，不得熟果樹下、若石上、塼上，當平地洗鉢。
When washing, do not wash on dangerous edges or pits, under ripe fruit trees, on rocks, on bricks, should wash on flat ground.

若地泥污、若糞掃、若無坐處，當僂身去地一磔手。
If the ground is muddy, dirty, or without a sitting place, should stoop away from the ground a span of a hand.

洗已曬令燥，還持繩綴。
After washing, dry it in the sun, then use a rope to patch it back.

綴已，舉著一處。
After patching, place it in one location.

不得著臨坑岸上危嶮處，熟鞞醯勒果樹下、椰子樹下、石上、塼上、行來處、開戶處。
Do not place it on dangerous edges or pits, under fully ripe fruit trees, coconut trees, on rocks, brick areas, resting places, or pathway entrances.

若著鉢囊中、若安置壁上龕中，以物遮口。
If placed in a bowl pouch or set in a wall nook, cover it with something over the opening.

若有事怱怱不得好洗者，當以根汁葉汁等塗拭，事訖當洗。
If in a hurry and cannot wash well, should apply root juice, leaf juice, etc., and after the matter is finished, wash it.

明日洗已，持入聚落乞食，設綴鉢難用一日乃了，要當洗淨。
Wash it the next day, and take it into the village to beg for food, if the patched bowl is difficult to use, for one day it should be used, must be clean-washed.

若故打破，得波夜提罪。
If intentionally broken, incurs a transgression offense.

若和上、阿闍梨知識作是念：「此賢善比丘，以洗鉢故，妨坐禪受經誦經。若打破、若藏去，不見已更乞無罪。」
If the teacher or mentor thinks: "This wise virtuous monk, because of washing the bowl, obstructs meditation, receiving and chanting scripture. If broken or hidden, unseen, requesting again without sin."

無鉢乞得一鉢應受持，若乞得兩鉢，一鉢應受持，一鉢應入眾僧淨厨;
Without a bowl, if obtaining a bowl through request, should accept and hold it, if getting two bowls through begging, one should be accepted and held, the other should enter the monks’ pure kitchen;

如是乃至得十鉢，一鉢自受持，九鉢應入眾僧淨厨。
Like this, even until obtaining ten bowls, one bowl should be accepted and held, and nine should enter the monks’ pure kitchen.

若比丘無鉢，求鉢得一鉢直者，是名有鉢。
If a monk has no bowl and seeks one to obtain a bowl directly, it is called having a bowl.

若乞得兩鉢直，一鉢直入眾僧淨厨，如是乃至十鉢直，九鉢直應入眾僧淨厨，是故說。
If requesting and obtaining two bowls directly, one bowl should directly enter the monks’ pure kitchen, in this manner, even up to ten bowls directly, nine should directly enter the monks’ pure kitchen, therefore it says.




祇洹精舍，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided at Jetavana Monastery in the city of Shravasti, elaborating as mentioned above.

世尊以五事利益故，五日一歷諸比丘房，見難陀、優波難陀住處，滿瓶酥、油、蜜、石蜜，流出根藥、莖藥、葉藥、花藥、果藥。
For the benefit of five reasons, the World-Honored One inspected the monks' rooms every five days and found that in Nanda and Upananda's living quarters there were jars full of ghee, oil, honey, and molasses, with herbal extracts of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits overflowing everywhere.

佛知而故問：「諸比丘！此誰住處，有此滿瓶酥、油、蜜等，處處溢流如是？」
The Buddha intentionally asked, "Monks! Whose residence is this, where jars full of ghee, oil, honey, and others are overflowing everywhere like this?"

諸比丘答言：「世尊！此是難陀、優波難陀住處。」
The monks replied, "World-Honored One! This is the residence of Nanda and Upananda."

爾時世尊言：「待來當問。」
At that time, the World-Honored One said, "Wait, I will ask them later."




大林重閣精舍，廣說如上。
The Buddha was staying at the Great Forest Monastery in Vaishali, explaining extensively as above.

世尊到時著衣持鉢，共眾多比丘，入毘舍離大城，見優波難陀持滿鉢蜜出城。
The Blessed One, dressed and carrying his alms bowl, together with many monks, entered the great city of Vaishali and saw Upananda carrying a full bowl of honey out of the city.

見已知而故問：「此鉢中何等？」
Upon seeing this, he knowingly asked, "What is in this bowl?"

答言：「世尊！是蜜。」
He replied, "Blessed One, it is honey."

復問：「欲作何等？」
He asked again, "What do you intend to do with it?"

答言：「難陀病須。」
He replied, "Nanda is sick and needs it."

佛言：「太多。」
The Buddha said, "That's too much."

答言：「竟日須服。」
He replied, "He needs to take it throughout the day."

佛言：「云何畜藥竟日服耶？從今日不得畜藥竟日服。」
The Buddha said, "How can you stockpile medicine to take it throughout the day? From today onward, you may not stockpile medicine for all-day consumption.


復次佛住迦維羅衛尼拘律樹釋氏精舍。
Again, the Buddha resided in the Shakya monastery under the Nyagrodha tree at Kapilavastu.

世尊以五事利益故，五日一行諸比丘房。
For the benefit of five things, the World-Honored One would visit the monks' quarters every five days.

何等五？
What are the five?

一者我聲聞弟子不著有為事不？
First, are my disciples not attached to worldly affairs?

二者不著世俗戲論不？
Second, are they not attached to worldly discussions?

三者不著睡眠妨行道不？
Third, are they not obstructed by sleep from practicing the path?

四者為看病比丘不？
Fourth, is it to take care of the sick monks?

五者為年少比丘新出家，見如來威儀，起歡喜心。
Fifth, is it to inspire joy in young monks newly ordained, by seeing the Tathagata's demeanor?

是為五事。
These are the five things.

如來五日觀歷諸房，見一病比丘顏色痿黃羸瘦。
The Tathagata, during his five-day visit to the rooms, saw a sick monk who looked pale and emaciated.

佛知而故問：「比丘！汝調和不？」
The Buddha, knowing this, asked, "Monk, are you comfortable?"

答言：「世尊！我病苦，不調和。」
He replied, "World-Honored One, I am suffering from illness, not comfortable."

佛言：「比丘！汝不能索隨病食及隨病藥治耶？」
The Buddha said, "Monk, can you not obtain food and medicine according to your illness?"

答言：「世尊制戒畜藥，時服不得久停，是故我苦。」
He replied, "The World-Honored One has established rules against storing medicine, so I suffer."

佛告諸比丘：「從今日聽病比丘停藥一日。」
The Buddha told the monks, "From today, the sick may store medicine for one day."

爾時佛問難陀：「汝舍衛時多畜酥、油、蜜、石蜜耶？」
Then the Buddha asked Nanda, "When you lived in Shravasti, did you store a lot of butter, oil, honey, and rock sugar?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
He replied, "Indeed, World-Honored One!"

佛言：「汝云何多欲無厭？」
The Buddha said, "Why are you so greedy without restraint?"

種種呵責已，自今已後不聽多畜。
Having admonished him in various ways, from now on, he was not allowed to store much.



羅奈仙人鹿野苑，廣說如上。  
Furthermore, the Buddha resided in the Deer Park of the Seers at Benares and expounded as above.

時有六十病比丘，有一醫師出家為道，療治諸病比丘。  
At that time, there were sixty sick monks, and a physician had renounced the world and was treating the sick monks.

是醫比丘來問訊世尊，頭面禮足，却住一面。  
The physician monk approached to pay respects to the Blessed One, bowed at his feet, and stood to one side.

佛知而故問：「醫師比丘！諸病比丘調和不？」  
The Buddha, knowing it, asked: "Physician monk, are the sick monks recovering?"

答言：「世尊！諸病比丘安隱，但我疲苦。」  
He replied, "Blessed One, the sick monks are at ease, but I am weary."

佛言：「何故疲苦？」  
The Buddha asked, "Why are you weary?"

答言：「世尊！波羅奈城去此半由旬，為求所須，日日往返，以是疲苦。  
He answered, "Blessed One, the city of Benares is half a yojana away, and I go back and forth daily to acquire necessities, hence I am weary.

又世尊！聽病比丘停藥一日，病疾已過。」  
Moreover, Blessed One, you allow the sick monks to stop taking medicine for a day, and their illnesses are already cured."

佛問醫師：「比丘！欲使畜藥幾日得安隱耶？」  
The Buddha asked the physician, "Monk, how many days would storing the medicine provide peace?"

答言：「世尊！藥勢相接七日可知。」  
He replied, "Blessed One, it is known that the potency of medicine connects over seven days."

佛言：「從今日聽先一日，更與六日七日畜。」  
The Buddha said, "Starting today, allow for one day first, and moreover store it for another six days, making seven."


佛告諸比丘：「依止波羅奈住者盡集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told the monks: "All those residing in Varanasi should gather, for the benefit of ten gains, rules are established for the monks, and even those who have heard should listen again.

若病比丘所應服藥，酥、油、蜜、石蜜、生酥、脂，如是病比丘聽畜七日服。

If a sick monk needs to take medicine, such as ghee, oil, honey, rock honey, fresh ghee, or fat, the sick monk is allowed to keep these for seven days for consumption.

若過七日殘不捨而服者，尼薩耆波夜提。

If he keeps and consumes it beyond seven days without relinquishing, it is a 'Nisaghiya Pacittiya' offense.




比丘者，如上說。

此不言作然燈油、塗足油、塗身油，不記識不作淨，過七日，尼薩耆。

不如法作淨者，若無心意人邊作淨，過七日，尼薩耆。

If a monk has a lower body ailment, he should first take ghee.

酥者七日藥，澡手洗口令淨，然後乃食。

If a monk receives ghee himself, and it's like ghee touching other substances like oil, honey, stone honey, raw ghee, fat, and vice versa, such as oil touching ghee, all should be considered similarly.
