夜深了，燈火依舊亮著。

The night is deep, but the lights are still on.

窗外的風聲在耳邊低語。

The sound of the wind outside whispers in my ear.

思緒隨著星星漫遊在遠方。

Thoughts wander far with the stars.

那是一個充滿希望的夢境。

It is a dream full of hope.

時光如水，靜靜流逝。

Time is like water, flowing quietly.

在孤獨中尋找溫暖。

Seeking warmth in solitude.

佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, speaking extensively as mentioned above.

爾時六群比丘交脚白衣家坐，為世人所譏：「云何沙門釋子如王子、大臣交脚坐家內？
At that time, six groups of monks were sitting cross-legged in laymen's homes, and were criticized by the people: "How can the ascetic disciples of the Shakyamuni sit cross-legged inside homes like princes and ministers?

此壞敗人，有何道法？」
What kind of discipline do these disruptive people follow?"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks informed the Blessed One of this incident.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Summon the six groups of monks to come."

來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」
When they arrived, the Buddha asked the monks, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後不得交脚家內坐。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you must not sit cross-legged inside the homes."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Let all those residing in Shravasti gather, for the sake of ten benefits I will prescribe a rule, and even those who have already heard it must hear it again."

不得交脚坐家內，應當學。
You should not sit cross-legged inside homes, and this should be followed.



著髀上、膝著膝上、膞膓著脚脛上、脚著脚趺上。
Cross-legged sitting means placing the thigh on the thigh, knee on the knee, calf on the shin, and foot on the foot top.

不得交脚坐家內，應正兩足。
Do not sit cross-legged inside the house; you should straighten both feet.

若精舍中食上、和上、阿闍梨、長老比丘前，不得交脚坐。
In the presence of the abbot, other seniors, teachers, or elder monks in the monastery, do not sit cross-legged.

If you are ill, you may sit cross-legged, but when a senior arrives, you should sit upright.

若塗足、挑刺交脚坐無罪。
If applying ointment to the feet or removing thorns, sitting cross-legged is not an offense.

若放恣諸根交脚坐家內，越學法。
If one indulges all senses and sits cross-legged inside the house, it violates the learned rules.

狂、癡、心亂無罪。
For the mad, ignorant, or those with a disturbed mind, it is not an offence.

是故說，不得交脚坐家內，應當學。
Therefore, it is said, do not sit cross-legged inside the house; this should be learned.

The monks, due to this incident, went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」

佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti, elaborating as above.

爾時六群比丘白衣家搖足坐，舞手並復折草，
At that time, six groups of monks were sitting in the homes of laypeople, shaking their feet, waving their hands, and breaking grass,

為世人所譏：「云何沙門釋子如放逸伎兒，
which led to criticism from the people: "How can the Shramana, disciples of the Shakya, act like careless performers,

在家內坐，手足不住？
sitting in homes, unable to keep their hands and feet still?

此壞敗人，有何道法？」
These unrestrained people, what kind of doctrine do they follow?"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
Because of this, the monks went to inform the World-Honored One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call those six groups of monks here."

來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」

They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後不得動手足白衣家內坐。」

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，
The Buddha told the monks, "All who reside depending on the city of Shravasti should gather together,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
for the benefit of ten reasons I establish a rule for you monks, even those who have heard before must hear again.

不得動手足坐家內，應當學。」

若檀越欲令比丘起精舍者，

If the benefactor wishes the monk to raise a temple,

應觀地形勢，隨作便指示，

He should observe the terrain and clearly indicate what is appropriate.

此中可起精舍、此中可起講堂、此中可起溫室、此中可起僧房，

Here a temple can be erected, here a lecture hall, here a greenhouse, here a monk’s room.

得指示無罪。

Indicating this is not a violation.

若放恣諸根動手足坐家內者，越學法。

，廣說如上。

爾時有檀越於精舍中設供飯僧下食，

At that time, a lay supporter set up a meal offering for the monks at the monastery.

時六群比丘方索水洗手滌鉢，

At that moment, the six groups of monks were just asking for water to wash their hands and clean their bowls.

檀越聞已，即持熱飯筐撲地，

Upon hearing this, the lay supporter immediately dropped the hot food basket on the ground.

嫌言：「我廢家務就寺設供，望眾僧齋，同淨心修福。

Complaining, he said: "I neglected my household duties to offer this meal at the temple, hoping the monks would eat with pure minds and cultivate blessings.

今欲下食，方有所索。

Now, just as I am about to serve the meal, requests are being made.

出家之人應專心受食，云何食上多有所索？」

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。

The monks reported this incident to the World-Honored One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」

The Buddha said: "Call the six groups of monks to come."

來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」

爾時有長者就精舍中飯僧，六群比丘先多受羹，後受飯。  
At that time, an elder invited the monks to a meal in the monastery, and six groups of monks received more soup first, then rice.  

時鉢中溢出墮地，檀越嫌言：「我奪妻子分飯食眾僧，欲盡令食而今棄地。尊者不知耶？  
At that moment, the bowls overflowed and fell to the ground, and the donor complained, "I take away from my family to feed the monks, wanting them to eat completely, but now it's wasted on the ground. Does the Reverend not know this?  

此一粒飯中而有百功。」  
This grain of rice contains a hundred efforts."

If there are no leaves, you may use a bowl for the soup, but when receiving rice, cover it with your hand and gently lower it into the bowl so it doesn't spill over.

若比丘病宜多須羹者，多取無罪。
If a monk is ill and needs more soup, taking more is not a fault.

Do not await food with open mouths, one should learn this discipline."



不得張口待飯食者，比丘食時當如雪山象王食法，食入口已，並以鼻作後口分齊。
One should not open their mouth to wait for food; a monk should eat like the king of elephants in the snowy mountains, eating in moderation and only after the food has been placed in the mouth, with the nose used as the back of the mouth to maintain evenness.

前食咽已，續內後團，不得張口而待食。
After swallowing the first portion, they should insert the next portion without opening their mouth to await the food.

These disgraced people, what kind of doctrine do they follow?"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks, due to this incident, went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the group of six monks here."

來已，佛問：「汝實爾不？」
Once they had arrived, the Buddha asked, "Did you really do this?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "Yes, indeed."

佛言：「從今日後不得擲團食。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you are not to eat by throwing food balls."

佛告諸比丘：「皆悉令集，
The Buddha instructed the monks: "Gather everyone together,

十利故與諸比丘制戒，
For the sake of ten benefits, I establish rules for the monks,

乃至已聞者當重聞。
So that those who have heard can hear again.

不得擲團食，應當學。」
You should not eat by throwing food balls, and this should be learned."



擲團食者，不得團飯遙擲口中。
Those who throw lump food should not throw it from afar into their mouths.

若酸棗若葡萄，如是種種乃至熬豆，挑擲噉無罪。
If it is sour jujubes, grapes, or the like, even roasted beans, throwing and eating them is not an offense.

若放恣諸根擲團食者，越學法。
If one indulges their senses and throws lump food, it transgresses the learning rule.

狂、癡、心亂無罪。
For the mad, foolish, or disturbed in mind, there is no offense.

是故說，不得擲團食，應當學。
Therefore, it is said that one must not throw lump food, and should learn this.




，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti and elaborated as above.

爾時有居士於精舍設供飯僧，
At that time, a householder arranged a meal offering for the monks at the monastery.

時六群比丘囓半食半還著鉢中，
Then, six groups of monks took a half-eaten portion and put it back into their bowls,

為世人所譏：「云何沙門釋子如放逸人囓半食。
Which led people to criticize: "How can the followers of the Shakya, the Sramanas, behave like negligent people, biting half-eaten food?

此壞敗人，有何道法？」
These are degenerate people, what teachings do they follow?"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks reported this incident to the Bhagavan.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已，佛問：「汝實爾不？」
After they came, the Buddha asked, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered, "Yes, it is true."

佛言：「從今日後不得囓半食。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, do not bite half-eaten food."

佛告諸比丘：「皆悉令集，十利故與諸比丘制戒，
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather everyone, for the sake of ten benefits, I lay down a rule for the monks,

乃至已聞者當重聞。
Even those who have already heard, must hear it again.

不得囓半食，應當學。」
Do not bite half-eaten food; you should train accordingly."



不得囓半食半還著鉢中，當段段可口食。
Do not bite and eat half, then put it back in the bowl. You should eat it in pieces that are fit for consumption.

若麨團大，當手中分令可口。
If the dough ball is large, divide it by hand to make it fit for consumption.

若欲食菓蓏、苷蔗、若蕪菁根等，得囓無罪。
If you wish to eat fruits, sugarcane, or turnip roots, you may bite them without fault.

若餅，當手作分齊令可口。
If it's a cake, divide it by hand to make it fit for consumption.

若放恣諸根囓半食者，越學法。
If you indulgently bite half and eat it, you violate the teachings.

狂、癡、心亂無罪。
Insanity, foolishness, and mental disturbance are without fault.

是故說，不得囓半食，應當學。
Therefore, it is said: do not bite half and eat it; this should be learned.
