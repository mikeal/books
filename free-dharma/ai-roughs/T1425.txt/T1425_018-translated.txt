第 1 卷

Volume 1

佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。

The Buddha was in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park, in the country of Sravasti.

與大比丘眾千二百五十人俱。

With a great assembly of 1,250 bhikkhus.

爾時大德阿難在眾中坐。

At that time, the venerable Ananda was seated among the gathering.

即從坐起整衣服足。

Immediately, he rose from his seat and arranged his robe.

偏袒右肩胡跪叉手。

Bare his right shoulder, knelt on one knee, and joined his palms.

白佛言：世尊！今此眾僧。

He addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, the present assembly of monks."

已集在此唯願世尊。

"Has gathered here, we only wish, World-Honored One."

開悟法眼聽法眼淨說。

"To receive the opening of the Dharma Eye, and hear the pure explanation of the Dharma Eye."

佛告阿難言：善哉。善哉。

The Buddha said to Ananda: "Excellent, excellent."

汝今如是安住梵行。

"Now you abide in the Brahma conduct."

我當開示汝顯現猗。

"I shall now reveal and make manifest."

汝且善聽我所說法。

"Listen well to the Dharma that I shall expound."

云何能知能見佛法灌頂。

How can one come to know and see the Buddha's Dharma direct yourself like this?

，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī and expounded extensively as above.

時阿利吒比丘不捨惡見，眾僧作舉羯磨已，往尊者難陀、優波難陀所，見已讚言：「善來！」
At that time, the monk Arittha refused to give up his wrong views, and after the community of monks conducted a formal act, he went to Venerable Nanda and Upananda, and upon seeing them he praised saying, "Welcome!"

即起迎，與小床坐、洗足水，與塗足油、非時漿，與房舍、床褥、臥具，共法食味食。
They immediately got up to welcome him, offered him a small seat, foot washing water, foot ointment, untimely drink, room, bedding, and shared food and the taste of the Dharma with him.

阿利吒比丘到祇洹精舍門前，語諸比丘言：「長老！汝等與阿利吒比丘作舉羯磨，謂更無住處耶？
When Monk Arittha arrived at the gate of Jetavana Monastery, he said to the monks, "Elders! You performed the formal act with Monk Arittha; did you think there would be no other place for him to stay?

我乃更得諸梵行比丘共住，與我房舍床褥臥具，共我法食味食。
I have actually found other pure practice monks to stay with, who provided me with room, bedding, sleeping gear, and shared their Dharma food and taste with me.

汝等早舉我者，當早得如是好住處。」
If you had raised me sooner, you would have obtained such a good place to stay sooner."

諸比丘聞是語已，慚愧不樂，即以是因緣，往白世尊。
The monks, after hearing these words, felt ashamed and displeased. Due to this matter, they went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼難陀等來。」
The Buddha said, "Call Nanda and the others to come."

來已，佛問難陀：「汝等實爾不？」
After they arrived, the Buddha asked Nanda, "Is this true for you?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
They replied, "It is true, Blessed One."

佛言：「此是惡事。汝云何知眾僧作舉羯磨已，復共法食味食？
The Buddha said, "This is a wrong action. How can you, knowing that the community of monks has conducted a formal act, still share food and the taste of the Dharma?

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
This is against the Dharma, against the Vinaya, not in accordance with the Buddha's teachings, and cannot be used to nurture good qualities."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "All residing in the city of Śrāvastī should gather, and for the ten benefits, a rule is established for the monks, even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘知比丘作惡見不捨，僧作舉羯磨、若未作如法，共食、共同室住，波夜提。」
If a monk knows that another monk holds wrong views and does not renounce them, whether the community has conducted a formal act or not, if they share food or live together in the same room, it results in a Pācittiya offense.


比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu, as mentioned above.




知者，若自知、若從他人聞。
One who knows may know from oneself, or hear from others.




惡見者，如阿利吒等謗契經。
Those with wrong views, like Ali and others, slander the sutras.




未作如法者，
For those who have not acted according to the rule,

僧未與解舉擯羯磨。
the assembly has not yet performed the act of censure or expulsion.



共食者，共法食味食。
Those who eat together, share the taste of legal food.




共同居住在同一个领域。

Living together in the same domain.

共享同一间房，共同遮盖与庇护。

Sharing the same room, jointly providing cover and shelter.




波夜提者，如上說。

The Boddhicaryavatara, as mentioned above.




若有一比丘為和上、阿闍梨所嫌，比丘不得誘引言：「我與汝衣鉢、疾病醫藥、床褥、臥具，汝當在我邊住，受經誦經。」
If a monk is disliked by his teacher or mentor, he should not entice another by saying, "I will give you clothing, medicine for illness, bedding, and sleeping materials, you should stay by my side, receive and recite the scriptures."

若觀彼比丘因緣，若是必當捨戒就俗者，得誘取。
If observing the monk’s circumstances, he is bound to abandon his vows and return to lay life, then he may be enticed.

誘取已，當教言：「汝當知和上、阿闍梨其恩甚重難報，汝應還彼目下住。」
Once enticed, he should be taught, "You should know that the kindness of your teacher or mentor is profound and difficult to repay, you should return to live under their guidance."

無罪。
No offense.

舉不舉想，共住共食，越比尼罪。
Whether thinking of expulsion or not, living and eating together constitutes an infringement of monastic rules.

不舉舉想，共住共食，越毘尼罪。
Not expelling while thinking of expulsion, living and eating together constitutes an offense against the Vinaya.

舉舉想，波夜提。
Thinking of expulsion, it is an offense requiring confession.

不舉不舉想，無罪。
Not expelling without thinking of expulsion is not an offense.

是故說。
Therefore, it is said.



，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī and expounded as above.

爾時阿利吒有沙彌，字法與，作是言：「長老！如來說法我解知，世尊說：『婬欲障道法。』習婬法不能障道。」
At that time, a novice named Dharmayū lived with Arliṭa and said, "Elder! I understand the Buddha's teachings; the World Honored One said, 'Desire obstructs the path.' Practicing desire does not obstruct the path."

時諸比丘作是言：「沙彌！汝莫謗世尊！謗世尊者不善。汝不善取。世尊說：『習婬法實障道。』」一諫、二諫、三諫不止。
Monks then said, "Novice! Do not slander the World Honored One! Slandering the World Honored One is not good. You have misunderstood. The World Honored One said, 'Practicing desire truly obstructs the path.'" After the first, second, and third admonitions, he still did not stop.

諸比丘以是因緣，往白世尊。
Due to this reason, the monks went to inform the World Honored One.

佛語諸比丘：「是法與沙彌作是語：『如來說法我解知，世尊說：「婬法障道。」習婬不能障道。』」
The Buddha told the monks: "This novice Dharmayū said, 'I understand the Buddha's teaching, the World Honored One said, "Desire obstructs the path." Practicing desire does not obstruct the path.'"

汝等當屏處三諫、多人中三諫、僧中三諫，令捨此事。
You should exhort him in private three times, among the public three times, and within the assembly three times, to forsake this matter.

屏處應問言：「汝沙彌！實作是語：『如來說法我解知，世尊說：「習婬欲障道法。」習婬法不能障道。』汝已三諫不止耶？」答言：「實爾。」
In private you should ask, "Novice! Did you truly say, 'I understand the Buddha's teaching, the World Honored One said, "Practicing desire obstructs the path." Practicing desire does not obstruct the path.' Have you not stopped after being admonished three times?" He answered, "Indeed."

爾時屏處應諫：「沙彌！汝莫謗世尊！謗世尊者不善。汝不善取。世尊說：『習婬欲實障道。』我今慈心諫汝，欲饒益故，汝取我語。一諫已過餘二諫在。汝捨此事不？」
At that time, you should privately exhort: "Novice! Do not slander the World Honored One! Slandering the World Honored One is not good. You have misunderstood. The World Honored One said, 'Practicing desire truly obstructs the path.' With a compassionate heart, I counsel you for your benefit, accept my words. One admonition has passed, two remain. Will you abandon this matter or not?"

若不捨，應第二、第三諫，亦復如是。多人中三諫，亦復如是。
If he does not abandon it, perform the second and third admonitions in the same way. The same applies for the three admonitions in public.

若不捨者，僧中應作求聽羯磨：「大德僧聽！是法與沙彌作是言：『如來說法我解知，世尊說：「婬欲障道法。」習婬欲不能障道。』已屏處三諫、多人中三諫而不捨。
If he still does not abandon it, the assembly should seek permission for an act of Sangha: "Venerable Sangha, listen! This novice Dharmayū said, 'I understand the Buddha's teaching, the World Honored One said, "Desire obstructs the path." Practicing desire does not obstruct the path.' He has been privately admonished three times, and in public three times, but he does not abandon it.

若僧時到，僧今亦應三諫，令捨此事。」
When the time comes for the Sangha, the Sangha should also admonish three times to make him forsake this matter."

僧中應問：「沙彌！汝實作是語：『如來說法我解知，世尊說：「婬欲障道法。」習婬欲不能障道。』已屏處三諫、多人中三諫而不捨耶？」答言：「實爾。」
Within the Sangha, they should ask, "Novice! Did you truly say, 'I understand the Buddha's teaching, the World Honored One said, "Desire obstructs the path." Practicing desire does not obstruct the path.' Have you not abandoned it after being privately admonished three times, and in public three times?" He answered, "Indeed."

僧中應作是諫：「汝沙彌！莫謗世尊！謗世尊者不善，汝不善取，習婬欲實障道。眾僧慈心諫汝，為饒益故。汝當取僧語。一諫已過餘二諫在，汝當捨此事。」
In the assembly, they should exhort: "Novice! Do not slander the World Honored One! Slandering the World Honored One is not good. You have misunderstood. Practicing desire truly obstructs the path. The Sangha, with compassionate hearts, exhorts you for your benefit. Accept the words of the Sangha. One admonition has passed, two remain. You should forsake this matter."

若不捨，第二、第三亦如是諫。
If he does not forsake it, the second and third admonitions should be the same.

猶故不捨。諸比丘以是因緣，往白世尊。
If he still does not forsake it, the monks should inform the World Honored One of this reason.

佛告諸比丘：「是法與沙彌作如是言：『世尊說：「婬欲障道法。」我解知習婬欲不能障道法。』已屏處三諫、多人中三諫、僧中三諫，不捨者，應驅令出眾。」
The Buddha told the monks: "This novice Dharmayū said, 'The World Honored One said, "Desire obstructs the path." I understand it as practicing desire does not obstruct the path.' After being privately admonished three times, in public three times, and in the assembly three times, if he does not forsake it, he should be expelled from the assembly."

驅出已，往至六群比丘所，見已讚言：「善來！」與非時漿、與房舍、與床褥臥具、與衣鉢病瘦醫藥。
After being expelled, if he goes to the group of six monks and is greeted with "Welcome!" receiving untimely offerings, accommodation, bedding, clothing, alms, and medicine for the sick.

沙彌得是種種供給已，到祇洹門前，語諸比丘言：「長老等驅我出眾，謂我更不能得住處。
The novice, having received these various supplies, goes to the Jeta's Grove gate and says to the monks, "The Elders expelled me thinking I could no longer find a place to stay.

我今乃更得梵行人共住，與我房舍床褥臥具，共我法食味食，與我衣鉢病瘦醫藥。
But now I have found people who practice Brahmacharya to live with, providing me housing, bedding, food, and medicine.

諸長老！若早驅我者，我當早得如是樂住。」
Elders! If you had expelled me earlier, I would have enjoyed such a happy dwelling sooner."

諸比丘聞是語已，心不悅，即以是事往白世尊。
Hearing these words, the monks were displeased and went to inform the World Honored One of this matter.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Summon the group of six monks."

來已，佛問六群比丘：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」
When they came, the Buddha asked the group of six monks, "Is it true?" They answered, "Indeed."

佛告六群比丘：「此是惡事。汝云何知沙彌惡見不捨，眾僧如法驅出，汝云何共住法食味食？
The Buddha told the group of six monks, "This is an evil deed. How could you, knowing that the novice does not forsake his wrong view and has been rightly expelled by the Sangha, still live together and provide him with food?

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
This is against the Dharma, against the Vinaya, and not in accordance with the Buddha's teaching; it cannot nurture good Dharma."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks: "All those residing in Śrāvastī are to be gathered. For ten benefits, give the monks the disciplinary rules, so that even those who have heard may hear again.

若沙彌作如是言：『如來說婬欲障道法，我解知，習婬欲不能障道。』
If a novice says: 'The Buddha teaches that desire obstructs the path. I understand that practicing desire does not obstruct the path.'

諸比丘應諫沙彌作是言：『汝沙彌莫謗世尊！謗世尊者不善。世尊說：「習婬欲實障道。」汝捨此惡見。』
The monks should admonish the novice, saying: 'Novice, do not slander the World Honored One! Slandering the World Honored One is not good. The World Honored One said, "Practicing desire truly obstructs the path." Abandon this wrong view.'

諸比丘諫是沙彌，故不捨者，應如是第二、第三諫。
If the monks admonish the novice and he still does not forsake it, he should be admonished a second and third time accordingly.

若捨者善，若不捨，諸比丘應作是言：『從今日汝沙彌不應言：「佛是我師。」亦不得共比丘三宿。
If he forsakes it, good. If he does not forsake it, the monks should say: 'From today, novice, you should not say "The Buddha is my teacher," nor should you stay with the monks for three nights.

汝去，不得此中住。』
Go, you may not reside here.'

若比丘知沙彌惡見不捨驅出，未作如法，誘喚畜養，共食共同室住，波夜提。」
If a monk knows a novice with a wrong view that has not been forsaken and has been expelled but not properly, and still invites, supports, shares food, and stays in the same room with him, it results in a Pācittiya offense.


沙彌者，如法與沙彌等。
A novice is like one who abides by the rules as do other novices.

If a novice monk, aware of this, returns to lay life, gentle words can be used to persuade him.

Therefore it is said.




佛住王舍城，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in Rajagaha, teaching extensively as above.

爾時諸比丘著未截縷疊衣，外道亦著未截縷衣。
At that time, various monks were wearing uncut, layered robes, and the outsiders also wore uncut cloth.

時優婆塞欲禮比丘而禮外道，聞呪願已，乃知是外道，優婆塞心懷慚愧。
When lay followers intended to pay respects to the monks but did so to the outsiders, upon hearing their chants, they realized they were outsiders and felt ashamed.

外道弟子欲禮外道而禮比丘，聞呪願已，乃知是比丘，外道弟子心懷慚愧。
When the disciples of the outsiders intended to pay respects to the outsiders but did so to the monks, upon hearing their chants, they realized they were monks and felt ashamed.

諸比丘以是因緣，往白世尊，佛言：「從今日後當作異衣截縷染色。」
Due to these circumstances, the monks approached the Buddha, and the Buddha said, "From today onwards, you should cut the cloth differently and dye it."

比丘即截縷染作異色。
The monks then cut and dyed the cloth into different colors.

時外道持赤石染衣作色，留周羅持三奇杖作異。
At that time, the outsiders dyed their clothes using red stones, and Lu Zhoulou carried a triple-staff as a distinction.



復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Additionally, the Buddha dwelled in the city of Śrāvastī and expounded as above.

爾時曠野比丘得憍舍耶衣，煮染汁欲染，世尊乘神足空中往比丘所，知而故問：「比丘！欲作何等？」
At that time, a monk in the wilderness obtained a Kashaya robe, boiled dye with the intention to dye it. The Blessed One, using his divine power, went through the air to the monk and deliberately asked, "Monk! What are you intending to do?"

答言：「煮染汁欲染憍舍耶衣。」
He replied, "I am boiling dye to color the Kashaya robe."

佛言：「憍舍耶軟細，染汁麁澁，損壞此衣。」
The Buddha said, "The Kashaya is soft and fine, but the dye is coarse and rough; it will damage this robe."

佛言：「從今日後憍舍耶衣作二種淨：截縷淨、青淨。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, the Kashaya robe will be purified in two ways: cutting loose purification and green purification."




復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, the Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti and spoke extensively as before.

爾時毘舍離比丘得軟欽婆羅衣，煮染汁欲染。
At that time, a monk from Vaishali received a soft Kimbara robe and prepared dye to color it.

佛以神足往到其所，知而故問：「比丘！汝作何等？」
The Buddha used his divine powers to visit him and knowingly asked, "Monk! What are you doing?"

答言：「煮染汁欲染欽婆羅。」
He replied, "I am preparing dye to color the Kimbara."

佛言：「欽婆羅軟細，染汁麁澁，損壞破衣。」
The Buddha said, "Kimbara is soft and delicate, the dye is coarse and harsh, it will damage the robe."

佛言：「從今日後聽欽婆羅衣作二種淨：截縷淨、青淨。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, Kimbara robes are allowed to be purified in two ways: by cutting threads and using blue dye."




衛城，廣說如上。
Again, the Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī, explaining extensively as above.

爾時尊者孫陀羅難陀，佛姨母子、大愛道所生，有三十相，少白毫相、耳垂埵相。
At that time, Venerable Sundara Nanda, the son of the Buddha’s maternal aunt and Mahāprajāpatī, possessing thirty marks, with a few noticeable marks like the tuft of hair and extended earlobes.

乞食已，從舍衛城中出，時尊者阿難在後。
After alms, he left Śrāvastī, with Venerable Ānanda following him.

諸比丘食已，在祇洹精舍門間經行坐禪，遙見其來謂是世尊！
The monks, after eating, were walking and meditating between the gates of the Jetavana monastery and saw him coming from afar, thinking he was the Buddha!

即皆起迎叉手合掌言：「世尊來！世尊來！」
They all stood up to greet him with hands folded in reverence, saying, "The World-Honored One has come! The World-Honored One has come!"

孫陀羅難陀亦叉手合掌作是言：「諸長老！我是孫陀羅難陀，我是孫陀羅難陀。」
Sundara Nanda also folded his hands and said, "Reverend elders! I am Sundara Nanda, I am Sundara Nanda."

諸比丘聞其語已，各懷慚愧，以是因緣往白世尊，
The monks, hearing this, each felt ashamed, and because of this incident, went to report to the World-Honored One,

佛言：「從今日後當作點壞色衣。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you should make clothes with patches of different colors."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "All who reside relying on Śrāvastī should gather, so as to establish ten benefits and introduce discipline, even those who have heard it before should hear it again.

若比丘得新衣，當三種壞色，若一一壞色：青、黑、木蘭。
If a monk gets new clothes, they should be of three damaged colors: blue, black, or madder.

若不作三種，一一壞色受用者，波夜提。」
If they are not made into three different colors, using just one color, it would be Pācittiya (an offense)."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as stated above.




得者，若男、若女、若在家、出家人邊得。
The one who attains this, whether man or woman, whether layperson or monastic.




新衣者，最初成衣者，欽婆羅衣、

The new garment is the first made garment, the Kambala robe,

疊衣、芻摩衣、

the folded robe, the soaked robe,

憍舍耶衣、舍那衣、

the Kaushaya robe, the shawl,

麻衣、驅牟提衣。

the hemp robe, the Kumuda robe.




三種壞色，若一一壞色者：青、黑、木蘭。
Three kinds of bad colors, if each is a bad color: blue, black, mulberry.

青者，銅青、長養青、石青。
Blue ones are copper green, nourishing green, stone blue.

銅青者，持銅器，覆苦酒瓮上著器者，是名銅青。
Copper green is from holding a copper vessel, a vessel covered on a sour wine urn.

長養青者，是藍澱青。
Nourishing blue is indigo blue.

石青者，是空青。
Stone blue is sky blue.

持是等作點淨。
Hold these to make dot purification.

黑者，名字泥、不名字泥。
Black ones are name mud and non-name mud.

名字泥者，呵梨勒、𨡕醯勒、阿摩勒，合鐵一器中，是名名字泥。
Name mud is herira, sanghila, amala, mixed in an iron vessel, called name mud.

不名字泥者，實泥、若池泥、井泥，如是一切泥。
Non-name mud is real mud, pond mud, well mud, all such mud.

木蘭者，若呵梨勒、𨡕醯勒、阿摩勒，如是比生鐵上磨持作點淨，是名木蘭。
Mulberry is herira, sanghila, amala, rubbed on raw iron for purification, called mulberry.

比丘得新衣不作淨受用者，波夜提。
If a monk receives new clothes and does not purify them before use, it is an offense.



波夜提者，如上說。

Prajñapti, as mentioned above.




若得新僧伽梨作淨者善，不作淨者，波夜提。
If a new Sanghati is purified, it is good; if not purified, it is a transgression.

如是欝多羅僧、安陀會、雨浴衣、覆瘡衣、尼師壇，作淨者善，不作淨者，波夜提。
Similarly, for the upper garment, the inner garment, the robe worn in the rain, the wound-covering robe, and the sitting cloth, if purified, it is good; if not, it is a transgression.

欽婆羅衣作二種淨：截縷淨、青點淨。
The Kimpala robe is purified in two ways: by cutting threads purification and by blue-spot purification.

作截縷淨，不作青淨，波夜提。
If threads are cut for purification, but there is no blue purification, it is a transgression.

作青淨，不作截縷淨，越毘尼罪。
If blue purification is done but threads are not cut for purification, it is a minor transgression.

不作青淨、不作截縷淨，得一波夜提、一越毘尼罪。
If neither blue purification nor thread cutting is done, this results in one transgression and one minor transgression.

作截縷淨、作青淨者，無罪。
If both thread cutting and blue purification are done, there is no transgression.

疊衣作三種淨：截縷淨、染淨、青淨。
Folded clothes are purified in three ways: by cutting threads, dyeing, and blue purification.

作截縷淨、作染淨，不作青淨，得一波夜提。
If threads are cut for purification and dyeing is done, but no blue purification, it results in one transgression.

作青淨，不作截縷淨、不作染淨，得二越毘尼罪。
If blue purification is done without thread cutting or dyeing, it results in two minor transgressions.

不作截縷淨、不染淨、不作青淨，犯一波夜提、二越毘尼罪。
If no thread cutting, dyeing, or blue purification is done, it results in one transgression and two minor transgressions.

作上三種淨，無罪。
If all three purifications are done, there is no transgression.

芻麻衣三種淨，同疊衣。
Hemp robes have three purifications, same as folded clothes.

憍舍耶二種淨，同欽婆羅衣。
Kosala robes have two purifications, same as Kimpala robes.

舍那衣、麻衣、驅牟提衣三種淨，同疊衣。
Shaṇa, hemp, and Kṣaumika robes have three purifications, same as folded clothes.

青、黑、木蘭作淨，亦復如是。
Purification with blue, black, and mūla colors is similar.

作淨時不得大、不得小，極大齊四指，極小如豌豆。
When purifying, it should not be too big or too small, the maximum is four fingers wide, and the smallest is like a pea.

若持呵梨勒、𨡕醯勒、阿摩勒，鐵上研取汁作點淨，不得並作，或一、或三、或五、或七、或九，不得如華形作淨。
If using harela, heella, amala, pound on iron and extract juice for spot purification, it should not be done together, either one, three, five, seven, or nine, and cannot be shaped like a flower.

若浣疊時有泥墮上、若烏鳥泥足蹈上，即名為淨。
If while washing a fold mud falls on it or a bird with muddy feet steps on it, it is named purified.

若得眾多雜碎新物，若合補一處者，一處作淨。
If you get many small new pieces to patch one place, make that place purified.

若各各別補者，一一作淨。
If each piece is patched separately, each one is purified.

若新作僧伽梨，趣一角作淨。
If a new Sanghati is made, head to one corner for purification.

若一條、若半條補者亦作淨。
If one strip or half a strip is patched, it is also purified.

欝多羅僧、安陀會，及一切衣，乃至新紐褋亦作淨。
The upper garment, inner garment, and all clothes, including new ties and belts, should also be purified.

是故說。
Thus it is said.




佛住王舍城，廣說如上。
The Buddha was residing in Rajagriha, expounding broadly as above.

爾時韋提希子阿闍世王十五日月盛滿時，洗浴塗身著新淨衣，與諸群臣在正殿上。
At that time, on the fifteenth day of the full moon, King Ajatasattu, son of Vaidehi, bathed and anointed himself, put on new clean clothes, and was with his ministers in the main hall.

時王語一大臣言：「今是月盛滿日，我等當詣何處沙門、婆羅門，能得長養善根處？」
Then the king said to a minister, "Today is the full moon day, where should we visit among the ascetics and Brahmins to nurture good roots?"

大臣答言：「不蘭迦葉在王舍城中，是大沙門亦有大眾，王應往彼，能長養善根。」
The minister replied, "Puranakasyapa is in Rajagriha, he is a great ascetic with a large assembly, the king should go there to nurture good roots."

王默然不答。
The king remained silent and did not reply.

復有一臣言：「是薩遮尼乾子在王舍城中，是大沙門，可往詣彼，能長養善根。」
Another minister said, "Santrackita is in Rajagriha, he is a great ascetic, you may visit him to nurture good roots."

如是一一大臣是外道弟子者，各各稱讚其師，皆言：「應往詣彼，能長養善根。」
Each minister, being a disciple of non-Buddhist philosophies, praised their own teacher, all saying, "You should visit them to nurture good roots."

爾時耆舊童子在阿闍世王後，執蓋而侍，王告童子：「眾人皆語，汝何故默然不言。今月盛滿應詣何處，得長養善根？」
At that time, a senior youth was standing behind King Ajatasattu holding a canopy, and the king said to him, "Everyone has spoken; why do you remain silent? Where should we go on this full moon to nurture good roots?"

童子白王：「世尊今在我菴婆羅園中，與千二百五十比丘共在彼住。若往彼者，可長養善根。」
The youth answered the king, "The Blessed One is now residing in Ambapali's garden with 1,250 monks. If you go there, you can nurture good roots."

王即可其所言，便告耆舊童子：「汝速嚴駕五百牸象，一一象上載一夫人。」
The king approved of this and instructed the senior youth, "Quickly prepare 500 female elephants, with one lady on each elephant."

時耆舊童子即如教嚴駕，嚴駕訖往白王言：「嚴駕已辦，宜知是時。」
The senior youth immediately prepared the elephants as instructed, and once ready, informed the king, "The elephants are prepared, you should know the time."

時阿闍世王與五百夫人，夜半時執炬燈明前後圍繞，出王舍城，詣菴婆羅園。
At midnight, King Ajatasattu, with 500 ladies carrying torches to light the way around them, left Rajagriha for Ambapali's garden.

欲到園門時，諸比丘皆悉坐禪，王即悚然，顧謂童子：「汝云有千二百五十比丘在汝園中。云何如是大眾寂然無聲？汝將無欺誑我耶？」
As they approached the garden gate, the king saw all the monks sitting silently in meditation, and he was startled, asking the youth, "You said there are 1,250 monks in your garden. How is it that such a great assembly is silent without a sound? Are you deceiving me?"

童子報言：「實不欺王，但當直前。」
The youth replied, "Indeed, I am not deceiving the king. Just go straight ahead."

童子即指示言：「此大堂中燃燈明處，世尊當中坐，威德特尊巍巍無上，猶如牛王在牛群中；如師子王在眾獸中；如雪山六牙白象王在象群中；猶如恒河深淵澄靜無聲，大眾默然亦復如是。」
The youth pointed and said, "In the great hall where the lamps are lit, the Blessed One sits in the center, majestic and unparalleled, like the king of bulls among a herd of cattle; like the lion king among beasts; like the six-tusked white elephant king among elephants; as silent and serene as the deep pools of the river Ganges, so is the great silent assembly."

又如大海無量水歸，世尊大眾功德無量亦復如是。
"Also, like the great ocean to which innumerable waters return, the virtues and merit of the great assembly of the Blessed One are likewise immeasurable."

爾時阿闍世王小復前行，下乘步進至佛所，遶佛大眾三匝而住，語童子言：「世尊大眾寂然清淨功德成就，願使我子優陀夷跋陀功德成就，亦得如是。」
At that time, King Ajatasattu moved forward a little, dismounted, and approached the Buddha. He circumambulated the great assembly three times and said to the youth, "The great assembly of the Blessed One is silent and pure, with perfect merit. May my son Udraibadha also achieve such merit."

佛告大王：「隨所求願皆當得之。」
The Buddha said to the great king, "Whatever wishes you have, they shall all be fulfilled."

時王敷座，請佛令坐。佛語：「大王自坐，佛自有座。」
The king then prepared a seat and invited the Buddha to sit. The Buddha said, "Great king, you sit. The Buddha has his own seat."

時王頭面禮佛足，禮佛足已却坐一面，白佛言：「世尊！欲有所問，唯願聽許。」
The king bowed down to the Buddha's feet and after paying homage, sat to one side, saying to the Buddha, "Blessed One! I wish to ask something and hope you will permit it."

佛告大王：「恣所欲問，當為汝說。」
The Buddha told the great king, "Ask whatever you desire; I will speak to you."

王白佛言：「世尊！此中種種工師於佛法中出家，可現世得沙門果不？」
The king said to the Buddha, "Blessed One! Can the various craftsmen who have renounced the world for the Buddha's Dharma attain the fruits of asceticism in this very life?"

如《現法沙門果經》中廣說。
It is widely explained in the Pratyutpanna Samadhi Sutra.

爾時說法經久，諸夫人著寶瓔珞重故，各各解置座前。
After a long time of teaching, the ladies removed their heavy jeweled necklaces and placed them in front of their seats.

時阿闍世王有殺父罪故，心常驚怖，聞城中鼓聲吹貝聲、象聲、馬聲，王大怖畏，即告諸夫人：「可還入城！可還入城！」
Because of his crime of parricide, King Ajatasattu often felt fearful. When he heard the sound of drums, conchs, elephants, and horses from the city, he was greatly afraid and immediately told the ladies, "We should return to the city! We should return to the city!"

夫人去速。忘不取瓔珞。
The ladies left quickly, forgetting to take their necklaces.

還宮中已，到明清旦，王大夫人欲著瓔珞求覓不得，著衣人言：「昨來倉卒恐忘在彼。」
After returning to the palace, at dawn, the king's chief consort wished to wear her necklace but could not find it. She said to those dressing her, "In the haste of last night, I fear I forgot it there."

如是諸夫人皆云：「忘瓔珞如是眾多，若白王者王或嫌責。」
Similarly, all the ladies said, "So many of us forgot our necklaces. If we tell the king, he might be displeased."

爾時有青衣白王言：「諸夫人昨夜還速多忘瓔珞。」
At that time, a servant in blue reported to the king, "The ladies returned quickly last night and many forgot their necklaces."

時有外道婆羅門，是王師，共王在坐，即語王言：「若忘在彼，諸沙門皆當藏去，假令往求會不可得。」
At that time, there was a non-Buddhist Brahmin, who was the king's teacher, sitting with the king, and he told the king, "If they were left there, those ascetics must have taken them; you won’t find them even if you go back."

時王遣可信人試往推求，見佛大眾儼然而坐，及見諸夫人瓔珞悉在本處，日光照曜光焰赫然。即收持還，具以白王。
The king then sent a trustworthy person to investigate, who saw the Buddha’s assembly sitting solemnly and found all the ladies' necklaces where they were left, shining brightly in the sunlight. He collected them and reported everything to the king.

王大歡喜言：「佛諸沙門真良福田，無貪無欲，特可信者，無過是眾，願常在我國中，我當盡形供養。」
The king was overjoyed and said, "The ascetics of the Buddha are truly a good field of blessings, without greed or desire, truly trustworthy ones. There's nothing like this assembly. I wish they would always remain in my land, and I will offer them lifelong support."

王即告諸夫人：「是汝瓔珞各各還取，不得雜亂競取好者。」
The king then told the ladies, "These are your necklaces, each of you take your own, do not mix them up or compete for the best ones."

諸比丘聞王外道師作是語，以是因緣，往白世尊，佛告諸比丘：「寶悉現在不取，已生人謗，況復取者。從今日後不聽取寶。」
The monks heard what the king's non-Buddhist teacher had said and brought this issue before the Blessed One. The Buddha told the monks, "Even without taking the valuables, slander has arisen. How much more if one were to take them? From this day forward, you are not permitted to receive valuables."



舍離，廣說如上。  
Again, the Buddha was residing in Vaiśālī, expounding as before.

爾時梨昌童子著雜寶腰帶，價直千萬，乘駟馬車出城遊戲，寶帶重滑不覺墮地。  
At that time, a boy named Lichang was wearing a belt encrusted with various jewels worth millions, and he went out of the city on a chariot pulled by four horses; the heavy belt slipped and fell to the ground without him noticing.

時有比丘從後而來，見寶帶在地，即呼言：「童子！童子！取汝寶帶。」  
A monk happened to come from behind, saw the jeweled belt on the ground, and called out, "Boy! Boy! Take your belt."

車聲響故，童子不聞。  
Due to the noise of the chariot, the boy did not hear him.

是比丘恐後人得故，在邊立住。  
The monk, fearing that someone else might take it, stood by the side waiting.

童子前行乃覺失帶，即馳車還，遙見比丘，即便問言：「汝於後來，頗見帶不？」  
When the boy realized he had lost his belt, he turned his chariot back, saw the monk from afar, and asked, "Did you see the belt from behind?"

比丘答言：「我見有帶，向遙喚汝，汝自不聞。」  
The monk replied, "I saw the belt and called you from a distance, but you didn't hear me."

童子即復問言：「為在何處？」答言：「在此。」  
The boy asked again, "Where is it?" The monk replied, "It is here."

童子即前取帶。  
The boy then went forward to retrieve the belt.

帶腰已，便捉比丘痛打手脚令熟，種種嫌罵言：「若我不還者，汝持帶去。」  
After tying the belt around his waist again, he attacked the monk, hitting his hands and feet mercilessly, cursing and saying, "If I hadn't returned, you would have taken the belt away!"

諸比丘以是因緣，往白世尊，佛言：「不取已生過患，況當取者。」  
The monks, due to this incident, reported it to the Buddha. The Buddha said, "Even not taking leads to trouble, how much more if you take?"




舍離，廣說如上。
Moreover, the Buddha was staying in Vaishali and expounded as above.

爾時比丘在蘇河上脫衣洗浴，時有梨車童子，亦詣河浴即脫耳環，以衣覆上，入水而浴。
At that time, a monk was bathing by the Su River, and a Licchavi boy also came to bathe, removing his earrings and covering them with his clothes before entering the water.

浴已上岸著衣，忘環而去。
After bathing, he went ashore, dressed, and forgot his earrings as he left.

比丘後出見此耳環，即遙呼言：「童子！童子！耳環在地。」
The monk later came out, saw the earrings, and shouted from afar, "Boy! Boy! Your earrings are on the ground."

童子去疾不聞其喚，行漸漸遠覺耳無環，即便還覓。
The boy went quickly and didn't hear the call; as he walked further, he realized his ears were without earrings and immediately returned to search for them.

遙問比丘言：「見我耳環不？」
From afar, he asked the monk, "Did you see my earrings?"

比丘答言：「耳環在此，我向見已，即遙喚汝，但汝去疾不聞喚聲。」
The monk replied, "The earrings are here, I saw them earlier and called out to you from a distance, but you went too fast to hear my voice."

時童子言：「今在何處？」
The boy then asked, "Where are they now?"

答言：「在此。」
The monk answered, "Here."

童子即取耳環，著已捉比丘反覆熟打，罵言：「如是如是子，我若不來，汝當持我環去。」
The boy then took the earrings, put them on, and grabbed the monk, beating him harshly and scolded, "If I hadn't come, you would have taken my earrings away."

諸比丘以是因緣，往白世尊，佛告諸比丘：「不取寶已生過患，況復取者。」
The monks, using this incident, went to report to the Blessed One, and the Buddha said to the monks, "Not taking the treasure has already caused harm, let alone taking it."


復次佛住迦維羅衛國釋氏尼俱律樹園，廣說如上。
Next, when the Buddha was staying at Nigrodha's Park in Kapilavastu, he spoke extensively as above.

時有釋子飯諸比丘，與諸宗親共行食，著金釧重行食不便，即脫釧置比丘脚邊而作是言：「此釧置阿闍梨足邊。」
At that time, a Sakyan was offering food to the monks and dining with relatives. Wearing a heavy gold bracelet was inconvenient, so he took it off and placed it by a monk's foot, saying, "This bracelet is left by the teacher's foot."

比丘食已，捨起，後人見之，即便持去。
After the monks finished eating and left, someone saw the bracelet and took it.

是釋子行食訖已，即便還歸，忘不取釧。
After the Sakyan finished eating and returned home, he forgot to take his bracelet back.

還家已乃覺無釧，便還本處求索不見。
Once home, he realized the bracelet was missing and returned to search for it, but could not find it.

即復覓所寄比丘，見已白言：「阿闍梨！還我向所寄釧。」
Then he went to the monk where he had left it and said, "Teacher, please return the bracelet I left with you."

比丘答言：「我憶汝寄釧，故在本處，我不取來。」
The monk replied, "I remember you left the bracelet here, but I did not take it."

釋子言：「我寄不得所而失此釧。」
The Sakyan said, "I left it with you and now it's lost."

心中不悅，即往佛所，頭面禮足，即白佛言：「我向以釧寄某比丘，不為掌視而今失之。」
Unhappy, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and said, "I left the bracelet with a certain monk, and now it is lost."

佛為釋子隨順說法，示教利喜，發歡喜心而去。
The Buddha taught the Sakyan accordingly, guiding him with beneficial teachings, and he left with a joyful heart.

去不久，佛言：「呼彼比丘來。」
Shortly after, the Buddha said, "Call that monk here."

即呼來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」
Once called, the Buddha asked the monk, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
The monk replied, "It is true."

佛告比丘：「汝若受人寄者，當為掌視。若不為受者，當言不受。」
The Buddha said to the monk, "If you accept something for safekeeping, you must watch over it. If not, say you won't accept it."

汝云何受人寄物而不為掌？
"How can you accept something for safekeeping and not oversee it?"

從今日後聽園內，若寶、若名寶，若自取、若使人取舉。」
"From today, in this park, whether it is a treasure or named a treasure, take it yourself or delegate someone to take it."

佛告諸比丘：「依止迦維羅衛住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all those residing in Kapilavastu, and for ten benefits, establish rules that those who have heard shall hear again.

若比丘，若寶、若名寶，園內若自取、若使人取，除餘時，波夜提。
If a monk takes a treasure or named treasure, in the park whether by himself or by sending someone, except at other times, it is an offense.

餘時者，比丘若寶、若名寶，若自取、若使人取，作是念：『有主求者與。』是名餘時。」
At other times, if a monk, whether treasure or named treasure, takes it himself or has someone take it, he should think, 'The owner is seeking it, return it.' This is called other times."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is, as stated above.




园内者，塔园内、僧园内。
Inside the garden, there are pagodas and monk gardens.




寶者，已成器，所謂天冠、寶蓋、瓔珞、拂柄、寶屐，如是等寶所成器也。
Treasure, referring to already crafted objects like heavenly crowns, precious canopies, necklaces, scepters, and jeweled sandals, are items made from such treasures.

名寶者，錢、金、銀、真珠、琉璃、珂貝、珊瑚、琥珀、頗瓈、赤寶銅、赤銅、鉛錫、白鑞、鐵等。
Items called treasures include money, gold, silver, pearls, crystal, mother-of-pearl, coral, amber, precious jewels, red copper, copper, lead, tin, white alloy, and iron.



取者，淨者得自手取，若不淨者使淨人取。
As for taking, the pure person may take with their own hands, but if not pure, have a pure person take it.




波夜提者，如上說。
The Pratyekabuddha, as it is said above.




塔園內、若僧園內，若見有寶、若名寶，若淨者自取，若不淨者使人取舉。  
At other times, if in the stupa garden or the monk's garden, one sees a treasure or something called a treasure, if it is pure, one may take it oneself; if not pure, one should have someone take it.

作是念：「有主求當與。」作如是念不異。  
One should think: "If there is an owner seeking it, it should be given to them." This thought should not differ.

若佛生時、大會得道時、轉法輪時、阿難羅睺羅大會時，爾時諸人若忘衣及嚴身具種種諸物，比丘忘衣鉢等物，若比丘見者當取，取應唱令問：「此是誰物？」  
When the Buddha is born, when the grand assembly attains the path, when the Dharma wheel is turned, and during the grand assembly with Ananda and Rahula, at that time, if people forget clothes and various items for dressing, or if a monk forgets items like robes and bowls, a monk who sees them should take them and announce, asking: "Whose item is this?"

若是主者與，若無識者，應懸著柱上顯現處，令人見之。  
If it belongs to the owner, give it to them; if it is not recognized, it should be hung on a conspicuous place on a pillar for people to see.

若有人言：「此是我物。」應問言：「汝何處失？」答相應者應與。若無人識者，應停至三月已。  
If someone says: "This is my item," they should be asked: "Where did you lose it?" If the answer corresponds, it should be given to them. If no one recognizes it, it should be kept for three months.

若塔園中得者，即作塔用。若僧園中得者，當作四方僧物用。  
If found in the stupa garden, it should be used for the stupa. If found in the monk's garden, it should be used for the benefit of the four directions of monks.

若是貴重物，寶瓔珞金銀者，爾時不得露現，唱令得寶。  
If it is a valuable item, such as a gem, necklace, gold, or silver, it should not be openly displayed, and it should be announced to allow it to be claimed.

比丘應審諦數看，有何相貌？然後乃舉。  
A monk should carefully examine it to see what features it has before raising it.

若有人來問：「我忘寶物，有見者不？」比丘爾時應問：「汝何處忘？汝寶有何相貌？」  
If someone comes asking: "I lost a valuable item, has anyone seen it?" The monk should then ask: "Where did you lose it? What are the features of your treasure?"

若不相應者，應語言：「此僧伽藍廣大，汝為可廣求。」  
If it does not correspond, one should say: "This monastery is vast; you may search broadly for it."

若相應者，應出寶，示言：「長壽！此是汝物不？」若言：「是」。比丘不得於一人前與，應集眾多人，教言：「汝歸依佛法僧，若世尊不制戒者，汝眼看猶不可得。」  
If it corresponds, the treasure should be presented, saying: "Venerable! Is this your item?" If they reply: "Yes." The monk should not give it in front of just one person; one should gather many people and instruct them: "You should take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; if the Blessed One had not established rules, you could not see this item with your eyes."

若言：「我此寶邊更有餘物。」應言：「長壽！我正得此，更不見餘物。」  
If they say: "There are more items beside this treasure," one should say: "Venerable! I only found this and have not seen other items."

應語言：「汝是惡人，汝但得此已為過多，云何方欲更索餘物謗人？若世尊不制戒者，汝不見此物。」  
One should say: "You are an unworthy person, getting this item alone is already too much; how can you even think to ask for more and slander others? If the Blessed One had not established rules, you would not see this item."

若如是猶復不了者，應將至優婆塞邊，應作是言：「我本正得此物，盡以還歸，而今方見誣謗。」  
If even so, they are still not satisfied, they should be brought to an upāsaka (lay devotee) and say: "I originally found this item and returned it all, and now I am being accused falsely."

爾時優婆塞應罵言：「如是如是子！汝得此物已為過多，而今反謗比丘。汝但去！我當與汝作對料理此事。」  
At this time, the upāsaka should scold them, saying: "Indeed, child! Getting this item alone is already too much, and now you even slander a monk. Just go! I will deal with this case for you."

若無有人來者，至三年，如上隨所得處，當界用之。  
If no one comes forth, after three years, it should be used according to where it was found, as previously mentioned.

若比丘入聚落，見地遺物不應取。若有人取與比丘，得受與者，即是施主故無罪。  
If a monk enters a village and sees something left on the ground, it should not be taken. If someone takes and gives it to the monk, the monk may accept it, as it is considered an offering and thus not a sin.

若比丘入聚落，見有遺衣物，或風吹來者不得，便作糞掃衣想取。  
If a monk enters a village and sees abandoned clothing or items blown around, they should not be taken, just like discarded rags.

若曠路無人，見有衣物應取，若見衣上有寶，應以脚躡斷棄之持去。  
If on an empty road with no people, one sees clothing or items, one may take them. If there is a treasure on the clothes, one should step on it and break it off before taking it away.

去時不應隱藏，應露捉使人見之。  
When taking it away, it should not be hidden but held openly so people can see it.

若衣上有穢污，為人所賤者，得覆以持去。  
If the clothing is dirty or despised by others, it may be covered and taken away.

若取時不覺衣裏有寶物者，還至住處見已，應與淨人知，掌作醫藥直。  
If during taking, one is unaware that there is a treasure in the clothes, upon returning to the residence and seeing it, they should inform a trusted person, usually the keeper of medical supplies.

若出聚落時，若道中見衣，衣上有久塵土當取，取已不得覆藏，當露現持去。  
When leaving a village, if one sees clothes along the way, covered with dust for a long time, one may take them. Once taken, it should not be hidden but openly carried.

若有主逐比丘，應語：「長壽！何故走？」答言：「我失衣。」應言：「此是汝衣不？」  
If the owner pursues the monk, they should say: "Venerable! Why did you leave?" The answer should be: "I lost my clothes." They should be asked: "Is this your clothing?"

若言：「是。」者應還，應作是教言：「汝當歸佛法僧，若世尊不制戒者，汝設見此衣，亦不可得。」  
If they say: "Yes," it should be returned, and one should instruct them: "You should take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; if the Blessed One had not established rules, even if you saw these clothes, you could not get them."

若故壞僧坊，欲更治掘地起基得寶藏者，若淨人不可信者，應當白王，王言：「此物應入我，我今施比丘作功德。」即名施主。  
If intentionally destroying a monastery to rebuild and discover treasures underground, and if the trusted person cannot be relied upon, the king should be informed, and the king says: "These should belong to me, but I bestow them on the monks for merit." Thus, the king is named as the donor.

若已用半、半在，王言：「汝何以用我物？若已用者止，在者送來。」比丘應送在者還。  
If half have already been used and half remain, and the king says: "Why do you use my items? Stop using those used and send the remaining ones back." The monks should return those remaining.

王若言：「何以用我物？盡送來。」比丘已用物者，應用僧物還，若僧無物應乞物還。  
If the king says: "Why use my items? Return everything." Monks who have used items should use monastic items to return them; if the monastery has no items, they should beg for items to return.

若言：「已用者止，功德屬我。」即名彼用。  
If the king says: "Stop using what is used, and the merit belongs to me." They are thus used by that person.

若治故塔得金銀寶物，若淨人不可信者，當白王；淨人可信者得取，停至三年。三年已，應用作塔事種種用。  
If during the repair of an old stupa, gold, silver, and treasures are found, if the trusted person cannot be relied upon, the king should be informed; if the trusted person is reliable, they may take it, keeping it for three years. After three years, it should be used for various stupa-related purposes.

若王家覺，問比丘言：「汝此中得寶藏不？」應答言：「得。」若已用者應答言：「得已用作此塔。」  
If the royal household becomes aware and asks the monk: "Did you find treasure here?" The answer should be: "Yes." If it has been used, one should answer: "Yes, used to build this stupa."

王言：「已作者止，此功德屬我。」若已用半、半在者，王言：「已用者止，在者歸我。」在者應與王。  
The king says: "Stop what is done, and the merit belongs to me." If half has been used and half remains, the king says: "Stop the used, and the remaining should return to me." The remaining should be given to the king.

若王言：「汝不知地中寶物應屬我耶？汝何以用？盡還我來。」比丘爾時應以塔物還。  
If the king says: "Do you not know that the treasures in the ground should belong to me? Why did you use them? Return everything to me." At this time, the monks should return by way of the stupa's items.

若塔無物者，應為塔乞物還。若王問言：「佛法戒律中云何？」  
If the stupa has no items, it should be begged for the stupa and returned. If the king asks: "What does the Buddhist law and Vinaya say?"

比丘應答言：「佛法中若塔地中得物，即作塔用。若僧地中得物，即作僧用。」  
Monks should answer: "In the Buddha's teachings, if an item is found in the stupa's ground, it is for the stupa's use. If found in the monk's ground, it is for monastic use."

王若言：「從佛法用者。」無罪。  
If the king says: "Use according to the Buddha's teachings." There is no sin.

若寶藏上有鐵券姓名，若彼王問：「諸大德！見寶藏上有如是姓名不？」比丘應答言：「見，已用作塔成。」  
If there is an iron slip with a name on the treasure, and the king asks: "Venerable ones! Did you see such a name on the treasure?" The monks should answer: "Yes, and it has been used to complete the stupa."

若彼言：「此是我家先人物，汝何以用？用者應還我。」  
If they say: "This is my family's early item, why did you use it? It should be returned to me."

若言：「已作塔成者，功德屬我。」無罪。「若已用半，半在者還我。」比丘爾時應還在者。  
If they say: "It has been used to complete the stupa, and the merit belongs to me." There is no sin. "If half has been used and half remains, return it to me." The monks should return the remaining at that time.

若言：「汝何以用我家先人物？一切盡還我來。」爾時應盡還，若塔有物應用還，若無者乞還。  
If they say: "Why did you use my family's early items? Return everything to me." At that time, everything should be returned; if the stupa has items, they should be used to return; if not, they should be begged to return.

若言：「此先人物，先人已死，此功德即屬彼者。」無罪。  
If they say: "These are early items, the early person has died, and this merit belongs to them." There is no sin.

作新僧伽藍、作新塔得物亦復如是，是故說。  
Building a new monastery or new stupa and finding items should also be treated in this way; thus it is spoken


，廣說如上。

The Buddha resided in Rajgir, explaining in detail as above.

王舍城有三溫泉：王溫泉、比丘溫泉、象溫泉。

Rajgir had three hot springs: the King's hot spring, the Monks' hot spring, and the Elephants' hot spring.

王溫泉者，王、王後宮夫人，及佛、諸比丘浴。

The King's hot spring was used by the King, the royal consorts, the Buddha, and various monks.

比丘溫泉者，佛、比丘僧浴。

The Monks' hot spring was used by the Buddha and the monastic community.

象溫泉者，象及一切人浴。

The Elephants' hot spring was used by elephants and all other people.

爾時諸比丘入王溫泉浴，時王以油塗身，欲入溫泉浴，問泉監言：「溫泉空不？」

At that time, some monks entered the King's hot spring to bathe. Meanwhile, the King, having oiled his body, wished to enter the hot spring and asked the attendant, "Is the hot spring empty?"

泉監答言：「泉中不空，有諸比丘浴。」

The attendant replied, "The hot spring is not empty; there are some monks bathing."

王言：「聽諸比丘浴訖，我今先詣世尊，還當浴。」

The King said, "Let the monks finish bathing. I will first visit the World-Honored One, then return to bathe."

到世尊所，頭面禮足已，還復問監言：「池中空未？」

Having reached the Buddha, paid his respects, he returned and asked the attendant again, "Is the pool empty yet?"

答言：「未空。」

The attendant replied, "Not yet empty."

如是至三，猶有比丘洗浴不止。

This happened three times, yet there were still monks bathing continuously.

王言：「聽浴，勿喚令出，我當還宮中浴。」

The King said, "Let them bathe, do not call them to come out, I shall return to the palace to bathe."

諸人聞已，皆嫌責言：「沙門釋子自言：『善好有德。』而固池中不令大王得浴。」

When the people heard this, they criticized, saying, "These monks, followers of the Shakya, claim to be virtuous and good, yet they monopolize the pool and do not let the great King bathe."

諸比丘聞已，以是因緣往白世尊。

The monks, having heard this, reported the matter to the World-Honored One.

佛語諸比丘：「何處有王盡能忍是？從今日不聽浴。」

The Buddha said to the monks, "Where in such a situation can a king tolerate this? From today onwards, bathing is not permitted.


復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, the Buddha stayed in the city of Śrāvastī and extensively explained as above.

爾時世尊制戒不聽浴，諸比丘不得浴故身垢污臭。
At that time, the World-Honored One established a rule forbidding bathing, so the monks became dirty and smelly.

爾時世尊為諸大眾說法，諸比丘在下風處坐，
Then the World-Honored One preached to the assembly, and the monks sat downwind,

恐污臭熏諸梵行人故。
fearing that their odor would affect the practitioners.

佛知而故問：「諸比丘！何故獨一處坐，似如恨人？」
The Buddha, knowing this, asked, "Monks! Why do you sit alone in one place as if you dislike others?"

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊制戒不聽浴故身垢污臭，
The monks said to the Buddha, "Because the World-Honored One established a rule forbidding bathing, we have become dirty and smelly,

恐熏梵行人，故在下風而住。」
and fear affecting others, so we sit downwind."

佛言：「從今日後聽半月一浴。」
The Buddha said, "From today onward, you are allowed to bathe once every half month."



復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, the Buddha stayed in the city of Śrāvastī and explained as above.

爾時諸比丘春月熱，不得洗故身體痒悶。
At that time, the monks were suffering from the spring heat, unable to bathe, and their bodies were itching and uncomfortable.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，
The monks, due to this reason, went to inform the World-Honored One,

佛言：「從今日後聽熱時二月半得浴，
The Buddha said: "From today onwards, during the hot months, bathing is allowed for two and a half months.

春後一月半、夏初一月，是名二月半。」
One and a half months after spring and one month at the beginning of summer, this is known as two and a half months."




復次佛住舍衛城安居竟，與諸比丘往憍薩羅國人間遊行，

Then the Buddha, having resided peacefully in Śrāvastī, traveled with the monks to the kingdom of Kosala to wander among the people.

道中草木深邃，下則熱氣所吸，上則為日所炙，大生苦惱。

On the road, the thick vegetation trapped heat below and the sun scorched from above, causing great distress.

馳走向水，如鹿赴池。

They ran towards water, like deer rushing to a pond.

佛知而故問，諸比丘具說上事，

The Buddha knew and deliberately asked, and the monks fully explained the situation.

以如是苦故，諸比丘競走赴水，

Because of the suffering, the monks hurriedly went to the water.

佛言：「從今日後聽行時得浴。」

The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you are allowed to bathe while traveling."



復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, when the Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, he extensively taught as above.

有五事利益故，世尊五日一行諸比丘房。
For the benefit of five reasons, the World-Honored One would visit the monks' quarters every five days.

有比丘病疥𭼦，佛知而故問：「比丘汝調適不？」
There was a monk suffering from scabies, and the Buddha, knowing this, asked, "Monk, are you well?"

答言：「不調適，我病疥𭼦痒，得數數浴便樂。
He replied, "I am not well, as I have itchy scabies, and I feel relieved when I bathe frequently.

世尊制戒不得浴，是故不樂。」
However, the World-Honored One has set a rule not to bathe, so I am not happy."

佛言：「從今日聽病比丘浴。」
The Buddha said, "From today onward, sick monks are permitted to bathe."




復次佛住曠野精舍，廣說如上。
Further, the Buddha stayed in the wilderness monastery, expounding as before.

爾時營事比丘輦泥輦塼，作種種作事，不敢浴故，即便持臥。
At that time, the monk who was engaged in tasks carried mud and bricks, doing various works, and dared not bathe, so he went to sleep.

明日清旦脚上有泥土處，佛知而故問：「比丘！汝脚上何故泥處」？
The next morning, there were muddy spots on his feet, and the Buddha knew this and asked, "Monk! Why are there muddy spots on your feet?"

答言：「世尊！我營事泥污身，畏犯戒故不敢浴，是故脚有泥土。」
He replied, "World-Honored One! I was engaged in tasks and got muddy, fearing to break the precept, I dared not bathe, therefore my feet have mud."

佛言：「從今日聽作時浴。」
The Buddha said, "From today onward, you are allowed to bathe during work."



復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Again, the Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti and expounded as above.

爾時諸比丘值大風起，塵土坌身，復值天雨，諸比丘不敢浴故，即便持臥。
At that time, the monks encountered a strong wind that covered them in dust and then it rained, so they dared not bathe and went to sleep like that.

明日清旦問訊世尊，佛知而故問：「比丘汝身上何以垢污如是？」
The next morning, they paid respects to the Buddha, who knowingly asked, "Monks, why are your bodies so dirty?"

答言：「世尊！昨日風吹塵土坌身，復值天雨，不敢浴故，身上有垢污。」
They replied, "World Honored One, yesterday the wind blew and covered us in dust, and then it rained. We did not dare to bathe, so our bodies are dirty."

佛言：「從今日聽大風時浴。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you are allowed to bathe when there is a strong wind."




復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, Buddha stayed in Shravasti and expounded as mentioned above.

爾時天晴有少雲起，須臾大雨，
At that time, the sky cleared and a few clouds appeared, leading to a heavy rain soon after.

佛告諸比丘：「此是閻浮提最初吉雨，
Buddha told the monks: "This is the first auspicious rain in Jambudvipa.

汝等應雨中洗浴，能除身中諸病瘡癬。」
You should bathe in the rain, as it can remove various diseases, sores, and scabs from your body.

諸比丘心疑：「世尊制戒不得浴，我等云何當浴？」
The monks were doubtful: "The Blessed One has set a precept prohibiting bathing, how then should we bathe?"

佛言：「從今日後聽雨時浴。」
The Buddha said: "From today onwards, you are permitted to bathe when it rains."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城比丘盡集，
Buddha told the monks: "All the monks residing in Shravasti should gather,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
for the purpose of ten benefits, I have established precepts for the monks, and those who have heard should hear again.

若比丘減半月浴，除餘時，波夜提。
If a monk bathes less than once every half month, except during other specified times, it is an offense of Pācittiya.

餘時者，春後一月半，夏初一月，
The other specified times are one and a half months after spring, and one month at the start of summer.

是二月半是熱時；病時、作時、風時、雨時、行時，是名餘時。」
These two and a half months are the hot season; during times of illness, work, wind, rain, and travel, are known as other times."



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhus, as mentioned above.




半月者，若十五日浴，數滿十五日復應浴。
For a half-month, if one bathes on the fifteenth day, they should bathe again after fifteen days.

若十四日、十三、十二、十一、十、九、八、七、六、五、四、三、二、一日浴，應從浴日數，要滿十五日乃應更浴。
If one bathes on the fourteenth, thirteenth, twelfth, eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, third, second, or first day, they should count from the day of bathing and bathe again once fifteen days have passed.




世尊說無罪。

Except during other times, the World Honored One speaks of being without sin.

熱時者，春後一月半、夏初一月，是二月半名熱時；不得取前後，當取現在。

Hot times refer to one and a half months after spring and one month at the start of summer, which makes two and a half months known as hot times; one should not consider the past or future, but focus on the present.

病時者，若比丘癬、疥𭼦、癰痤，如是種種病，須浴得適意者聽浴，是名病時；不得取前後，當取現在。

During times of illness, if a monk has scabies, itch, abscess, sores, and various such diseases, bathing for comfort is permitted, this is known as times of illness; one should not consider the past or future, but focus on the present.

作時者，若僧一切作時，比丘作泥作治房舍，若通水溝，若抒井、若泥房舍、若掃地、若洗浴和尚阿闍梨，乃至掃塔院僧院，下至五六動掃菷，得名作時，浴無罪；不得取前後，當取現在。

During times of work, when monks are working, such as building with mud, repairing rooms, digging ditches, cleaning wells, building rooms, sweeping the floor, washing the preceptor and teacher, or even sweeping the pagoda courtyard and monastery, down to small tasks requiring five or six people, these are considered working times; bathing is without sin; one should not consider the past or future, but focus on the present.

風時者，若比丘風吹塵土坌身，得洗浴無罪；不得取前後，當取現在。

During windy times, if a monk is covered in dust by the wind, bathing is without sin; one should not consider the past or future, but focus on the present.

雨時者，若天雨洗浴無罪；不得取前後，當取現在。

During rainy times, if it rains from the sky, bathing is without sin; one should not consider the past or future, but focus on the present.

行時者，三由延、二由延，下至一拘盧舍，若來若去，是名行時，洗浴無罪；不得取前後，當取現在。

During times of travel, whether it is three yojanas, two yojanas, or down to one krosha, whether coming or going, these are known as times of travel; bathing is without sin; one should not consider the past or future, but focus on the present.




波夜提者，如上說。

Prajñā is as mentioned above.




若比丘無上諸時，當作陶家浴法，
When a monk is engaged in spiritual practices at all times, he should follow the potter's method of bathing,

先洗兩髀兩脚，
first washing the thighs and legs,

後洗頭面腰背臂肘胸腋，
then washing the head, face, waist, back, arms, elbows, chest, and armpits,

是故說。
therefore it is said.



然火過三宿，  
The fire lasted for three nights,

與欲入聚落，  
And they wanted to enter the settlement,




謗經擯同止，
Detractors of the scriptures are both banished,

沙彌三色衣，
The novice wears three-colored robes,




取寶半月浴      
Take the treasure and bathe in the half-moon 

第五跋渠竟。  
The fifth Bachu ends.  




，廣說如上。  
The Buddha stayed in Vaishali and extensively explained as above.

爾時尊者優陀夷行道渴極，入聚落從女人索水：「姊妹！施我水。」  
At that time, the venerable Uttiya was extremely thirsty while on the road and entered a village to ask a woman for water: "Sister! Please give me water."

女人即以水與之。  
The woman immediately gave him the water.

水中有蟲，優陀夷見已，作是念：「我但飲此無蟲處。」  
There were bugs in the water. Uttiya saw it and thought, "I will only drink from the part without bugs."

飲時蟲隨水入口，飲已心生疑，即以是因緣，往白世尊。  
As he drank, the bugs went into his mouth with the water, and after drinking, he felt doubt. Because of this reason, he went to report to the World Honored One (the Buddha).

佛言：「汝云何知水有蟲而飲？此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。從今日後知水有蟲，不得飲。」  
The Buddha said, "Why did you drink knowing there were bugs in the water? This is not the Dharma, not the Vinaya, not in accordance with Buddhist teachings, and it cannot nurture good practices. From today onwards, do not drink if you know there are bugs in the water.


復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Then the Buddha stayed in Sravasti, explaining in detail as above.

時南方波羅脂國有二比丘，
At that time, there were two monks from the southern kingdom of Pārājika,

共伴來詣舍衛，問訊世尊。
Accompanying each other, came to Sravasti to greet the World-Honored One.

中路渴乏無水，前到一井。
On the way, they became thirsty and found no water, until they reached a well.

一比丘汲水便飲，
One monk drew water and drank,

一比丘看水見蟲，不飲。
While another saw insects in the water and did not drink.

飲水比丘問伴比丘言：「汝何不飲？」
The monk who drank asked his companion, "Why don't you drink?"

答言：「世尊制戒不得飲蟲水。
He replied, "The World-Honored One's precept restricts drinking water with insects.

此水有蟲，是故不飲。」
This water has insects, that's why I won't drink."

飲水比丘復重勸言：「長老！汝但飲水，勿令渴死不得見佛。」
The monk who drank further persuaded, "Elder! Just drink the water, don't die of thirst and miss seeing the Buddha."

答言：「我寧喪身，不毀佛戒。」
He replied, "I would rather sacrifice my body than break the Buddha's precept."

作是語已，遂便渴死。
After saying this, he died of thirst.

飲水比丘漸漸往到佛所，頭面禮足却住一面。
The monk who drank gradually went to the Buddha, respectfully bowed, and stood to one side.

佛知而故問：「比丘！汝從何來？」
The Buddha, knowing, asked, "Monk! From where have you come?"

答言：「我從波羅脂國來。」佛言：「比丘！汝有伴不？」
He answered, "I have come from the kingdom of Pārājika." The Buddha asked, "Monk! Do you have a companion?"

答言：「有二人為伴，道中渴乏無水到一井，井水有蟲，我即飲之，因水氣力得奉覲世尊。
He replied, "There were two of us, on the way we were thirsty with no water until reaching a well with insects. I drank, gained strength from the water, hence was able to greet the World-Honored One.

彼守戒不飲，即便渴死。」
He kept the precept and did not drink, thus died of thirst."

佛言：「癡人！汝不見我，謂得見我，
The Buddha said, "Foolish person! You think you see me without really seeing me,

彼死比丘已先見我。」
The monk who died already saw me first."

若比丘放逸懈怠不攝諸根，如是比丘雖共我一處，彼離我遠；
If a monk is negligent and undisciplined, even if physically close, he is far from me;

彼雖見我，我不見彼。
Even if he sees me, I do not see him.

若有比丘在海彼岸，能不放逸精進不懈，撿攝諸根，雖去我遠我常見彼，
If there is a monk on the other shore who is diligent and not negligent, disciplined, though far from me, I always see him,

彼常近我。」
He is always near me."

佛告比丘：「此是惡事，非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法，
The Buddha told the monks, "This is wrong, non-Dharma, non-discipline, not as taught by the Buddha, it cannot nurture good dharmas,

從今日後知水有蟲，不得飲。」
From today, knowing water has insects, it must not be drunk."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城比丘盡集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all the monks in Sravasti, to establish a precept for ten benefits,

乃至已聞者當重聞。
Even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘知水有蟲，飲者，波夜提。」
If a monk knows the water has insects and drinks it, he commits a pācittiya offense.



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as described above.




若知、若不知，皆由知者而成。

To know or not to know, all depend on the knower.

智者以彼智為不智。

The wise consider their knowledge as ignorance.

愚者以自小為無不知。

The foolish think their small knowledge as knowing everything.

知者，若自知、若從他聞。

Those who know, whether self-aware or informed by others.




蟲者，非魚鼈失收摩羅等。
Insects are not like the failed catches of fish and soft-shelled turtles.

謂小小倒孑諸蟲，乃至極細微形眼所見者。
They refer to small and upside-down insects, and even those that are extremely tiny and visible to the eye.




水者，十種，如上說。
There are ten types of water, as mentioned above.




飲者，齊入腹。
Those who drink together, fill their bellies together.




波夜提者。如上說。
Prajñāptivāda: As explained above.




已，要當畜漉水囊，應法澡盥。
Once a monk has received full ordination, he should possess a water filter bag and adhere to proper washing practices.

比丘行時應持漉水囊，若無者，下至受持欝多羅僧一角頭，看水時不應以天眼觀。
When a monk travels, he should carry a water filter bag, if not, at least hold one corner of his outer robe, and should not use clairvoyance to observe the water.

亦不得使闇眼人看，下至能見掌中細文者得使看水。
He should not ask a person with poor eyesight to examine the water; at least someone who can see fine details in the palm of their hand should be asked.

看水時不得厭課，當至心看，不得太速、不得太久，當如大象一迴頃、若載竹車一迴頃，無蟲應用。
While inspecting the water, one should not be distracted; observe with care, not too quickly nor too slowly, as if taking the time for an elephant to turn around or a cart to complete a lap, then use if it's free of insects.

若有蟲者，應漉用。
If there are insects, it should be filtered.

水有三階，下、中、上：若下分無蟲，中分、上分有蟲者，應取下分無蟲水用；
Water can be divided into three parts—bottom, middle, top: if only the bottom part is free of insects, use water from the bottom.

若中分無蟲，上分下分有蟲者，應取中分水用；
If only the middle is free of insects, use water from the middle.

若上分無蟲，應取上分水用。
If only the top is insect-free, use water from the top.

若上分有蟲者，應以手拍水，令蟲入水底已取用。
If the top has insects, stir the water with a hand to move insects to the bottom before using.

若三分盡有蟲者，爾時應漉水用。
If all three parts have insects, then the water should be filtered before use.

若水中蟲極細微者，不得就用洗手面及大小行。
If the insects in the water are extremely tiny, one should not use the water for washing hands, face, or cleansing after bathroom use.

若檀越家請比丘食，爾時應問：「汝漉水未？」
If a layperson invites a monk to eat, the monk should ask, "Have you filtered the water?"

若言：「未漉。」應看前人是可信者，應教漉水。
If they say, "No," the monk should see if the person is trustworthy and instruct them to filter the water.

若不可信者，不得語令漉，莫傷殺蟲。
If the person is not trustworthy, the monk shouldn't instruct them to filter and should avoid harming insects.

比丘應自漉用，蟲水應著自器中，應問：「從何處取水？」
The monk should filter the water himself, placing the insect-laden water in a personal container, and ask, "Where did you get the water from?"

隨來處還送蟲水瀉中。
The insect water should be returned and poured back where it came from.

若先取水處遠者，若見有池水，七日內不消盡者，得以蟲水著中。
If the original water source is far, yet there's visible pond water that won't dry up in seven days, it's permissible to add insect water there.

若無池水者，當器中盛水持來養之。
If there is no pond, water should be carried in a container to keep the insects.

若天大雨有瀑流水，以蟲瀉中，作是念言：「汝入大海去。」
If there's heavy rain with cascading water, pour the insect water into it, thinking, "You go to the ocean."

若比丘道中行渴須水，到井取水時當細看，無蟲得用。
If a monk is thirsty while traveling and needs water from a well, he should carefully check the water and use it if free of insects.

若有蟲者，當如上法淨漉得用。
If there are insects, he should purify and filter it as described earlier.

若知水有蟲，不得持汲水罐器繩借人。
If he knows the water contains insects, he should not lend his water-drawing tools or rope to others.

若池水汪水，當看已用。
If he sees pond water, he should examine it before use.

若見有蟲者，不得唱言：「長老！此水有蟲有蟲。」令前人生疑不樂。
If insects are seen, he should not shout, "Elder! This water has insects!" causing doubt and discomfort to others.

若前人問言：「此水有蟲不？」應答言：「長老自看。」
If someone asks, "Does this water have insects?" he should reply, "Elder, please look for yourself."

若知識同和上、阿闍梨者應語：「此水有蟲，當漉水用。」
If the one asking is a knowledgeable fellow, superior, or mentor, he should say, "This water has insects, you should use filtered water."

若有蟲無蟲想用，越毘尼罪。
If one uses water with insects, thinking it is free of them, it's a violation of the discipline.

若無蟲有蟲想，越毘尼。
If the water is free of insects but one thinks it has insects, it’s a breach of discipline.

若有蟲有蟲想用，波夜提。
Using water thinking it has insects when it does indeed have insects is a minor offense.

若無蟲無蟲想用，無罪。
Using water free of insects, knowing it's free, is without sin.

是故說。
Thus it is said


佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。

The Buddha stayed in the city of Sravasti and spoke extensively as above.

爾時尊者阿難名字吉具足、性吉具足、家吉具足。

At that time, Venerable Ananda was named Auspicious Complete, Nature Auspicious Complete, Family Auspicious Complete.

此三事故，為世人所重。

These three conditions were valued by the worldly people.

每至吉日，若入新舍嫁娶穿耳時，恒先請阿難。

On auspicious days, such as entering a new house, marriage, or ear-piercing ceremonies, they always invited Ananda first.

時有一家請尊者阿難食，有一外道出家人，黑色青眼大腹，來阿難所索食。

Once, a family invited Venerable Ananda to eat, and an outsider with dark skin, blue eyes, and a large belly came to Ananda asking for food.

阿難即與。

Ananda immediately gave it.

手掬噉已，以手拭身而去。

After taking the food in his hand and eating it, he wiped his body with his hand and left.

復有一外道來，問言：「汝何處得食？」

Another outsider came and asked, "Where did you get the food?"

答言：「我從此剃髮居士邊得。」

He replied, "I got it from this shaved-headed lay follower."

阿難聞此語已心不悅，後來乞者不與。

Ananda was displeased when he heard this, and did not give to later beggars.

阿難以是因緣，往白世尊。

Because of this event, Ananda went to report to the World Honored One.

佛語阿難：「此人不識恩分，從今日不聽自手與無衣外道出家人食。」

The Buddha said to Ananda, "This person does not know gratitude. From today on, do not personally give food to the unclothed outsiders who have renounced."



衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, the Buddha stayed at Śrāvastī and expounded as above.

爾時世尊四月一剃髮，世人聞佛剃髮故，送種種供養。
At that time, the World-Honored One shaved his head once every four months, and the people, upon hearing this, offered various kinds of offerings.

時世飢儉，有五百人常隨世尊乞殘食。
During a time of famine, five hundred people regularly followed the World-Honored One, begging for leftover food.

佛問阿難：「有殘食不？」
The Buddha asked Ānanda, "Is there any leftover food?"

答言：「有餅。」
Ānanda replied, "There is some bread."

佛言：「分與乞食人。」
The Buddha said, "Distribute it among those begging for food."

阿難即付人人與一番，中有外道出家女，阿難捉餅與。
Ānanda then distributed a portion to everyone, and among them was a woman who had left the household life from another sect; Ānanda gave her some bread.

時兩番相著去。
At that moment, the two portions stuck together when handed over.

彼得已共在一處食，作是言：「此餅乃極美好，但恨少，止得一番耳。」
Having received their portions, they ate together and said, "This bread is very delicious, but unfortunately too little, only enough for one serving each."

得兩番者，作是言：「我得兩番。」
The one who received two portions said, "I got two portions."

得一番者言：「阿難故當是汝婿，何故獨與汝兩番？」
The one who got only one portion said, "Ānanda must be your intended husband; why else would he give you two portions?"

阿難聞已不悅，以是因緣具白世尊。
Ānanda, upon hearing this, was displeased and reported the matter in full to the World-Honored One.

佛言：「從今日不聽自手與無衣外道出家男女食。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, do not personally give food to those who have left the household life from other sects who are without clothes."

諸比丘白佛言：「云何是外道不知恩分？」
The monks asked the Buddha, "Why is it that those from other sects do not know how to be grateful?"

佛言：「不但今日不知恩分，過去世時已曾如是。」
The Buddha said, "It's not just today that they don't know gratitude; even in past lives, it was like this."

如《仙人獼猴本生經》中廣說。」
As expounded in detail in the 'Birth Story of the Sage and Monkeys'."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者盡集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Those residing near Śrāvastī, gather in full assembly. For ten benefits, I will now introduce a precept, and those who have heard it must hear it again.

若比丘，無衣外道出家男女自手與食，波夜提。」
If a monk personally gives food to an unmarried man or woman of another sect who has left the household life, it is a pacittiya offense.


比丘者，如上說。
Bhikshus, as mentioned above.




無衣者，若無衣入有衣出、
The one without clothes, if he enters without clothes but leaves with clothes,

有衣入無衣出、
enters with clothes but leaves without clothes,

enters with clothes and leaves with clothes,

無衣入無衣出。
enters without clothes and leaves without clothes.

波夜提者，如上說。

A person who presents a petition, as stated above.




若比丘父母、兄弟、姊妹，在外道中出家來者，亦不得自手與食，當使淨人與食。
If a monk's parents, siblings enter the path outside and come, they must not personally give food; they should let a pure person give it.

若無淨人者，語令自取食。
If there is no pure person, they should be told to take the food themselves.

若恐外道噉盡者，應語言：「授與我來。」
If fearing the outsiders will eat it all, they should say: "Serve it to me."

得已應隨意減取已，若著床机地上，應語言：「汝自取食。」
After receiving, they may take some as they wish; if placed on a bed or seat, they should say: "You may take the food yourself."

若是親里外道，作是嫌言：「汝今便作旃陀羅遇我。」
If it is a relative outsider, they may complain and say: "You are treating me as an outcast."

比丘應答言：「汝出家不得處，世尊制戒如是，汝若食者便食，若不食者隨意。」
The monk should reply: "You have no place in the monastic life, the Blessed One set this rule; if you wish to eat, eat; if not, do as you please."

若比丘使外道作時，亦不得自手與食，當使淨人與。
If a monk has outsiders work for him, they must not give food personally, a pure person should give it.

若無淨人，如上法與。
If there is no pure person, give according to the method described above.

若外道來索米䊩汁飯汁漿，亦不得自手與。
If an outsider comes asking for rice or gruel, they must not be given it personally by hand.

若外道從眾僧中乞食，不得自手與，當放地與。
If an outsider begs for food from the monks, do not personally give it; it should be placed on the ground for them.

若外道有信心，欲供養比丘，爾時亦不得自手與飲食，得使外道作飲食，得使授食。
If an outsider has faith and wishes to offer food to monks, they also must not personally be given food; they may prepare food or serve it.

食已殘者與，與法如上說。
Leftovers may be given, as described in the method above.

是故說。
Thus it is spoken.



佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti, and explained extensively as mentioned above.

爾時尊者優陀夷，與知識婆羅門同村住。
At that time, the venerable Udayin was living in the same village with a knowledgeable Brahmin.

此婆羅門女出嫁，在異村住，遣信還白父言：「時時來看我，若尊不得來者，願令阿闍梨優陀夷時時來看我。」
The Brahmin's daughter got married and lived in another village, sending a message back to her father saying, "Visit me from time to time, and if you cannot come, I wish for Master Udayin to visit me regularly."

如前二不定中廣說，乃至佛語：「優陀夷！此是惡事。
As extensively spoken in the previous two indeterminate sections, the Buddha said, "Udayin! This is a bad deed.

在家人尚知沙門儀法，汝等出家人云何不知應坐、不應坐處？
Even householders know the conduct of monks, so how can you, as renunciates, not know where you should and should not sit?

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
This is not the Dharma, not the discipline, not as the Buddha teaches, and cannot be used to nurture good conduct."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all those residing in the city of Shravasti, and for ten benefits, I will establish precepts for the monks so that those who have heard them will hear them again.

若比丘知食家婬處坐者，波夜提。
If a monk knowingly sits in a household's lewd place, it is a Pācittika offense.

若比丘知食家屏處坐者，波夜提。」
If a monk knowingly sits in a household's secluded place, it is a Pācittika offense."

A knowledgeable person knows either by self-discovery or from others.




食者，麨飯、麥飯、魚、肉，如是種種名為食。

是故說。
Thus it is said.




，廣說如上。
The Buddha was staying in Savatthi, and he taught extensively as mentioned above.

爾時憍薩羅大臣名彌尼剎利反叛，時波斯匿王集四種兵，選擇良日，與諸大臣椎鐘擊鼓，欲往討伐。
At that time, a minister of Kosala named Mīnisha rebelled, and King Pasenadi mustered the four types of troops, chose an auspicious day, and, together with his ministers, sounded bells and beat drums, preparing to launch an attack.

爾時尊者難陀、優婆難陀往到軍前而立。
At that time, Venerable Nanda and Upananda went to stand in front of the army.

王見已，即却蓋曲躬遙敬。
The king, upon seeing them, immediately lowered his canopy and bent respectfully from afar.

時諸臣見已，即嫌言：「看是沙門釋子不知時，今大王欲討伐逆寇，當軍前立。
The ministers, seeing this, complained, saying, "Look at these ascetic followers of the Shakyamuni who don't know the proper time. Today, when the great king is about to attack the rebel enemy, they stand in front of the army.

又嫌大王將士眾，如是吉日求利見一剃髮沙門而便却蓋曲躬遙敬。」
Moreover, they disdain the king's troops, seeking good fortune on such an auspicious day by showing respect to shaven-headed ascetics, causing the king to lower his canopy and bend respectfully."

諸比丘聞已，以是因緣，往白世尊。
When the monks heard this, they went to report the incident to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼難陀、優波難陀來。」
The Buddha said, "Summon Nanda and Upananda."

來已，佛問：「汝實爾不？」
When they arrived, the Buddha asked, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "Indeed it is."

佛告諸比丘：「何有一切諸王，皆得信心如是？
The Buddha said to the monks, "How is it that all kings can gain such faith?"

從今日後不聽入軍中與相見。」
From today onwards, you are not allowed to enter the army and interact with them."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all those residing in Savatthi. For the sake of ten benefits, I establish a precept for the monks, even for those who have already heard, they should hear it again.

若比丘觀軍發行，波夜提。」
If a monk observes the army's march, it is a transgression."



d
比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as stated above.




軍發行者，執持戎器詣他國。
One who marches with the army carries weapons to another country.

軍有四種：象軍、馬軍、車軍、步軍。
There are four types of armies: elephant army, horse army, chariot army, and infantry.

象軍者，四人護象足，是名象軍。
The elephant army consists of four people guarding each elephant, hence called the elephant army.

馬軍者，八人護馬足，是名馬軍。
The horse army consists of eight people guarding each horse, hence called the horse army.

車軍者，十六人護車，是名車軍。
The chariot army consists of sixteen people guarding each chariot, hence called the chariot army.

步軍者，三十二人執持兵仗，是名步軍。
The infantry consists of thirty-two people holding weapons, hence called the infantry.

是名四種軍。
These are known as the four types of armies.

若比丘於此四種軍，若觀一一軍，波夜提。
If a monk observes each of these four types of armies individually, it is a transgression.



若比丘欲觀軍，從聚落中往阿練若處、阿練若處往聚落中，下處至高、高處至下，覆處至露處、露處至覆處，往觀見者，波夜提。
If a monk wants to watch the army, traveling from a village to a forest retreat, and from a forest retreat to a village, from a low place to a high place, from a high place to a low place, from a covered place to an exposed place, and from an exposed place to a covered place, and goes to observe, it is a violation.

若比丘入聚落城邑道中，逢軍陣不作意見，無罪。
If a monk goes into a village or town and encounters an army but does not intentionally watch it, there is no offense.

若作心，舉頭下頭窺望欲見，見者，波夜提。
If he does make up his mind, raises his head, lowers his head to peep, and wants to see, it is a violation.

若王出、若大象出時，街巷中窄滿，比丘爾時在一處住，不作意看，無罪。
If the king comes out, or a great elephant comes out, and the streets are full and narrow, at that time if a monk stays in one place and does not intentionally look, there is no offense.

若作意欲看者，得越毘尼罪。
If he intentionally looks, he breaches a monastic rule.

若比丘看象馬牛等鬪，乃至雞鬪，得越毘尼罪。
If a monk watches elephants, horses, cattle, or other animals fighting, even if it's a cockfight, he breaches a monastic rule.

若軍來詣精舍，不作意看，無罪。
If the army comes to the monastery and the monk does not intentionally look, there is no offense.

若作意看，得越毘尼罪。
If he intentionally looks, he breaches a monastic rule.

下至人口諍，看者，越毘尼罪。
Even participating in observing a quarrel among people, he breaches a monastic rule.

是故說。
Therefore, it is said.



佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha stayed in the city of Śrāvastī, and elaborated as above.

爾時憍薩羅國有剎利大臣名曰彌尼，叛逆不順。
At that time, there was a noble minister called Mīni from the Kosala kingdom who was rebellious and disobedient.

時波斯匿王遣大臣征人達多領四種兵，欲往討伐。
King Pasenadi dispatched a minister, General Dadda, along with four types of troops, to suppress him.

爾時征人達多遣信白世尊言：「我今征行，願遣諸比丘為我說妙法。」
Then, General Dadda sent a message to the Blessed One saying, "I am now on a campaign, and I wish for the monks to preach the wonderful Dharma to me."

於是世尊告阿難：「汝往軍中為征人達多說法。」
Therefore, the Blessed One told Ānanda, "You go to the army and preach the Dharma to General Dadda."

阿難到已，大臣即為設種種供養。
Upon Ānanda's arrival, the minister made various offerings to him.

爾時六群比丘知為阿難設種種供養，復往軍中食已，又觀試兵處，見不能者因毀呰言：「汝等效人乘象，如似騎猪，費王飲食，以此入陣，必自喪身，又失王象。」
Then, six groups of monks, knowing that offerings were made for Ānanda, went to the army, ate, and observed the soldiers' training grounds. Seeing those who were incapable, they criticized, saying, "You all imitate riding elephants but it's like riding pigs, wasting the king's provisions. Going into formation like this, you will surely lose your life and the king's elephants."

若見能者，因讚歎言：「善能乘象，捉鉤甚工，左右迴轉明曉鬪法，應食官祿。以此入陣，能自濟身，又不失象。」
If they saw someone capable, they would commend, "You are good at riding elephants, skilled at holding the hook, and adept at maneuvering around; you should receive the official stipend. Going into formation like this, you can protect yourself and not lose elephants."

若觀乘馬見不能者，便毀訾言：「汝效人乘馬，如似騎驢，費王飲食。以此入陣，必自喪身，又失王馬。」
If they observed those riding horses and saw someone incapable, they would criticize, "You imitate riding horses but it's like riding donkeys, wasting the king's provisions. Going into this formation, you will surely lose your life and the king's horses."

若見能者，便讚歎言：「汝善能乘馬，執轡甚工，左右迴轉皆有方便，應受王祿。以此入陣，必能濟身，又不失馬。」
If they saw someone capable, they would commend, "You are good at riding horses, skilled at holding the reins, adept at maneuvering; you should receive the king’s stipend. Going into formation like this, you surely can preserve yourself and not lose horses."

若觀乘車見不能者，毀訾言：「汝效人乘車，如上床法，費王飲食。以此入陣，必自喪身，又失王車。」
If they observed those on chariots and saw someone incapable, they would criticize, "You imitate riding chariots but it's like climbing onto a bed, wasting the king's provisions. Going into formation like this, you will surely lose your life and the king's chariots."

若見能者，讚歎言：「工能執御，善於進退，左右迴轉甚有方便，應受王祿。以此入陣，必能濟身，又不失車。」
If they saw someone capable, they would commend, "Skilled at handling the reins, good at advancing and retreating, adept at maneuvering; you should receive the king’s stipend. Going into formation like this, you can preserve yourself and not lose chariots."

若觀步軍見不能射者，便毀訾言：「效人執弓，似如拼毳，徒食官祿。以此入陣，必自喪身命，又失官弓。」
If they observed the foot soldiers unable to shoot, they would criticize, "Imitating holding a bow but it’s like fighting with feathers, just consuming the official stipend in vain. Going into formation like this, you will surely lose your life and the official bow."

見好射者，讚歎言：「平正美滿，實為工射，應受官祿。以此入陣，必自濟身，又不失弓。」
If they saw a good archer, they would praise, "Steady and perfect, truly skillful in archery, deserving of the official stipend. Going into formation like this, you can preserve yourself and not lose the bow."

觀持刀楯，見不能者，便毀訾言：「效人持楯，如捉布刀。以此入陣，必自喪身命，又失官仗。」
Observing those holding swords and shields, if they were incapable, they would criticize, "Imitating holding a shield but it’s like wielding a cloth sword. Going into formation like this, you will surely lose your life and the official weapon."

若見能者，又讚歎言：「善用刀楯，至為巧能。以此入陣，必自全身，又不失王仗。」
If they saw someone capable, they would commend, "Skillful with swords and shields, extremely adept. Going into formation like this, you can preserve yourself and not lose the king's weapon."

如是毀訾讚歎四種兵已，得毀訾者，各各怒曰：「何但彌尼剎利是我等怨，今此沙門亦復是賊，毀辱我等當共殺之。」
After praising and criticizing the four types of soldiers, those criticized became angry, saying, "Not only is the noble Mīni our enemy, but these monks are also thieves, insulting us; they should be collectively killed."

得稱讚者語得毀者言：「此諸沙門皆是王種，或大臣種、或剎利種，皆本習兵法，明曉戰陣。」
Those praised said to the criticized, "These monks are all from royal lineage, or ministers' lineage, or noble lineage; all are originally trained in martial arts and well-versed in warfare."

如彼所言：「汝等宜學而反怨彼，甚為大癡。」
As they said, "You should learn from them instead of resenting them; that would be extremely foolish."

諸得毀者聞此語已，深自慚愧。
Those who were criticized heard these words and felt deep shame.

尊者阿難見此事已，念曰：「我今宜去，若久住此，或生過患。」
The Venerable Ānanda, seeing this situation, thought, "I should leave now, lest staying longer brings trouble."

即還精舍。
He then returned to the monastery.

佛知而故問阿難：「汝已為征人達多說法訖耶？」
The Buddha knew this and purposely asked Ānanda, "Have you finished preaching the Dharma to General Dadda?"

阿難即以上事，具白世尊。
Ānanda reported the entire matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已，佛問六群比丘：「汝實爾不？」
After they came, the Buddha asked the six groups of monks, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
The Buddha said, "This is misconduct, not the Dharma, not the discipline, not as taught by the Buddha, and cannot nurture wholesome qualities."

從今日後有因緣聽入軍中三宿。」
From today onwards, you are allowed to stay in the army for three nights if there is a reason.

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told the monks, "All residing in the city of Śrāvastī should gather. For ten benefits, a rule was made for the monks, even those who have heard it already should hear it again."

若比丘有因緣，得到軍中三宿。
If a monk has a reason, he may stay in the army for three nights.

若過者，波夜提。」
If they exceed this, it is an offense of expiation."

If he stays one night with the archers, two nights with the lancers, three nights with the swordsmen, and four nights with the outer patrol, it is an offense.

If he stays one night with the spearmen, two nights with the swordsmen, three nights with the outer patrol, and four nights away from sight and hearing, there is no offense.

若為塔、為僧營事不訖，應離軍一宿已，得更宿。
If it is for the pagoda or the unfinished business of the monastic community, after leaving the army for one night, he may stay further.

若城邑遠不能往者，應離軍見聞處宿，宿時應語軍外邏人言：「我夜欲在某處宿，勿謂是異人。」
If the city is too far to reach, he should stay at a place away from the sight and hearing of the army, and when staying, he should tell the outer patrol of the army, "I wish to stay in such-and-such place tonight; do not consider me an outsider."

若軍人來到僧伽藍中住，不應捨去，雖多宿無罪。
If soldiers come to stay in the monastery, they should not be expelled, and even if many stay, there is no offense.

是故說。
Thus it is stated


佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in Śrāvastī, and expounded as previously stated.

爾時六群比丘再三軍中宿已，
At that time, the six groups of monks stayed in the army camp repeatedly,

到試兵處見不能乘象者，
went to the training grounds and saw those who couldn't ride elephants,

即毀訾言：「此人乘象似如乘猪，
and disparaged them, saying: "This person rides an elephant like riding a pig,

若入軍陣者必自喪身，
if they enter the battlefield, they will certainly lose their lives,

復失官象，費王廩祿。」
and also lose the royal elephant, wasting the king's provision."

見能乘象者如是讚言：「此人善能乘象，
Upon seeing those who could ride elephants, they praised, saying: "This person is skilled in riding an elephant,

捉鉤牽挽，左旋右旋，皆悉巧便。
grasping the hook to guide it, turning left and right skillfully.

若入陣者，必能破賊，又全身命。
If they enter the battlefield, they will surely defeat the enemy and preserve their lives.

如是人者，應食王祿。」
Such people deserve to receive the king's reward."

見不能乘馬乘車，捉弓刀楯矛矟，
Those who couldn't ride horses or drive chariots, and handle bows, swords, shields, spears, and lances,

乃至一一毀訾讚歎已，
were either disparaged or praised one by one until finished,

即便教言：「汝應作如是如是乘象乘馬，
and then they taught them, saying: "You should do like this when riding elephants and horses,

御車捉弓，捉楯捉矟。」
driving chariots, handling bows, shields, and lances."

諸不能者聞是語已，
Upon hearing these words, those who were incapable,

即瞋恚言：「何處更覓怨賊？
became angry and said: "Where else can enemies be found?

此即是賊，我等當共殺之。」
These are the enemies, and we should kill them together."

彼得讚者作如是言：「此諸比丘皆是王種，
Those who received praise said: "These monks are all of royal lineage,

大臣剎利種，皆知兵法。
all are ministers and kṣatriyas, and they know military tactics.

汝等何不善學而反怨他？」
Why do you not learn well and instead blame others?"

諸被毀者，聞是語已，
Those who were disparaged, upon hearing these words,

瞋心即滅，內自慚愧。
their anger vanished, and they felt ashamed internally.

諸比丘聞是語已，往白世尊。
The monks, having heard this, went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said: "Call the six groups of monks to come."

來已佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」
Having come, the Buddha thoroughly asked about the matter: "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered: "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，非法、非律、
The Buddha said: "This is evil behavior, not in accordance with the Dharma or Vinaya,

非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
nor the Buddha's teachings, and cannot cultivate good Dharma."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，
The Buddha told the monks: "All residing in Śrāvastī should gather,

以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
for the benefit of all, the monks should establish precepts, so that those who have heard will hear again.

若比丘有事緣，得軍中三宿，
If monks have business, they may stay three nights in the camp,

若觀軍發行、牙旗、諍鬪、勢力者，波夜提。」
and if they observe the army's maneuvers, flags, disputes, and strengths, they incur a Pācittiya offense."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu, as stated above.




三宿者，極齊三宿。
Those who stay for three nights, fully experience the essence of the three nights.




觀者，方便故往，若高處至下、下處至高。
The observer moves around conveniently, whether from high to low or low to high.




軍者，四種軍，如上說。
Armies are of four types, as mentioned above.




牙旗者，若師子形、若半月形。
The tooth flag is shaped like a lion or a half-moon.

諍者，口諍。
To argue is to dispute verbally.

鬪者，兩眾交刃。
To fight is when two groups cross blades.

勢力者，強弱相傾，觀其事勢，是名勢力。
To have power is when the strong and weak contend, observing their circumstances, this is called power.




夜半波濤翻騰，他倆靜靜地坐著。

In the middle of the night, waves churned, and they sat quietly.

如上所述, 他們在觀察著變幻。

As mentioned above, they were observing the changes.




若比丘道路行逢軍，不故看見者，無罪。
If a monk happens to encounter an army on the road without intentionally looking, there is no offense.

若作方便看見者，波夜提。
If he intentionally makes efforts to see, it is an offense of wrongdoing.

若抄賊從村中來，比丘道中相逢，不故看無罪。
If robbers come from a village and a monk happens to meet them on the road without intentionally looking, there is no offense.

作方便看見者，波夜提。

If a monk is walking in the wilderness and happens upon a group of robbers without intentionally looking, there is no offense.

作方便看見者，波夜提。
If he intentionally makes efforts to see, it is an offense of wrongdoing.

若比丘於林楙經行時，群賊劫村已，從比丘邊過。
If a monk is walking in the forest while a group of robbers has already raided a village and passes by the monk.

後逐賊人尋賊至比丘所，問比丘：「見賊不？」
Later, pursuers come searching for the robbers and ask the monk, "Did you see the robbers?"

比丘不得妄語，復不得語處，得語言：「看指押。」
The monk should not lie, and he should not indicate where. He may say, "Look, they have passed by."

若比丘城里住，有賊來圍城，王語比丘：「盡出上城現多人相。」
If a monk is living in a city and robbers come to besiege it, the king tells the monk, "Go up to the city walls to show there are many people."

不故看見者無罪。作方便看見者，波夜提。
If he happens to see without intention, there is no offense. If he intentionally makes efforts to see, it is an offense of wrongdoing.

是故說。
Therefore, it is said.




佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha stayed in the city of Śrāvastī, explaining extensively as above.

爾時六群比丘於禪坊中起，以拳捔十六群比丘頭，即便大啼。
At that time, six groups of monks in the meditation hall rose up and punched the heads of sixteen other monks, immediately causing a loud wailing.

佛聞啼聲，知而故問：「是中何等小兒啼聲？」
The Buddha heard the wailing and deliberately asked, "Whose childish cries are these?"

答言：「是六群比丘於禪坊中起，以拳捔十六群比丘頭，是故啼聲。」
The response was, "The six groups of monks in the meditation hall rose up and punched the heads of sixteen monks, hence the wailing."

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks."

來已佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」
Upon their arrival, the Buddha fully questioned the matter, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "Indeed, it is true."

佛言：「何以故爾？」
The Buddha asked, "Why did you do this?"

答言：「為戲樂故。」
They replied, "For the sake of amusement."

佛言：「癡人！此是惡事，惱諸梵行人而反言樂。」
The Buddha said, "Foolish people! This is an evil deed, troubling the practitioners and calling it fun."

佛語六群比丘：「莫輕彼人，彼人若入定者，以神足力擲汝著他方世界。」
The Buddha told the six groups of monks, "Do not underestimate those people, if they enter concentration, they might use their spiritual power to throw you to another world."

汝常不聞，我以無量方便，於梵行人所應起身口意行慈，供養恭敬。
Have you not always heard, that with countless methods, I act with kindness in body, speech, and mind towards practitioners, offering worship and respect?

云何作是惡不善事？
How can you commit such evil and unwholesome acts?

此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。
This is against the Dharma, against discipline, not according to Buddha's teaching, and cannot nurture good deeds.

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Let all those residing in Śrāvastī gather, and for ten benefits, I will establish a rule for the monks, so that even those who have heard before should hear again.

若比丘打比丘者，波夜提。」
If a monk strikes a fellow monk, it is a pācittiya offense."



比丘者，如上說。

Bhikshu, as mentioned above.




打者，若身、身分、身方便。
The act of hitting involves the body, body parts, or body tools.

身者，一切身是名身。
The body refers to the entire physical form.

身分者，若手、若脚、若肘、若膝、若齒、若爪甲，是名身分。
Body parts refer to hands, feet, elbows, knees, teeth, and fingernails.

身方便者，若捉杖、木、瓦、石等打若遙擲，是名身方便。
Body tools refer to using things like sticks, wood, tiles, or stones for hitting or throwing from a distance.




波夜提者，如上說。  
Bo-ye-ti means, as stated above.




了比丘，犯了波夜提罪。

If a monk hits another monk, it is a Pacittiya offense.

打比丘尼，就是偷蘭遮罪。

Hitting a nun is a Sanghadisesa offense.

打式叉摩尼、沙彌、沙彌尼，就是越毘尼罪。

Hitting a probationer nun, a novice monk, or a novice nun is a Dukkata offense.

下至俗人，就是越毘尼心悔。

Even hitting a layperson is a Dukkata offense that requires mental remorse.

若惡象馬牛羊狗，如是種種惡獸來，不得打。

If wild elephants or other such dangerous beasts come, one must not hit them.

得捉杖、木、瓦、石等打地作恐怖相。

You may grab a stick, wood, tiles, stone, etc., and strike the ground to create a scary noise.

若畜生來入塔寺中，觸突形像壞花果樹。

If an animal enters a stupa or temple and is damaging statues, flowers, or fruit trees,

亦得以杖、木、瓦、石等打地恐怖令去。

You may likewise strike the ground with a stick, wood, tiles, or stones to scare it away. 

是故說。

Thus it is said.




，廣說如上。

The Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti and elaborated as above.

世尊制戒不聽比丘相打。

The World-Honored One established a rule that did not allow monks to hit each other.

爾時六群比丘於禪坊中起，

At that time, six groups of monks were engaged in meditation in the hall,

以側掌刀擬十六群比丘，

and they motioned with their edged palms towards sixteen groups of monks,

作如是言：「我以掌刀斫墮汝面。」

saying, "I will strike and cut down your face with my hand like a knife."

彼恐怖故即便大啼。

They were so frightened that they cried out loudly.

佛聞啼聲，知而故問諸比丘：「是何等小兒啼聲？」

The Buddha heard the cries and knowingly asked the monks, "What is this child's crying voice?"

答言：「是六群比丘於禪坊起，

They replied, "It is the six groups of monks in the meditation hall,

以側掌刀擬十六群比丘，

motioning with their edged palms towards sixteen groups of monks,

作是言：『我以掌刀斫墮汝面。』

saying, 'I will strike and cut down your face with my hand like a knife.'

彼恐怖故，即便大啼。」

They were so frightened that they cried out."

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」

The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已，佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」

When they arrived, the Buddha thoroughly asked about the matter, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」

They replied, "It is true."

佛言：「何故如是？」

The Buddha said, "Why is this so?"

答言：「以戲樂故。」

They replied, "For the sake of amusement."

佛言：「癡人！此是惡事，

The Buddha said, "Foolish people! This is an evil deed,

惱諸梵行人而言戲樂。」

troubling practitioners of Brahmacharya and calling it amusement."

佛言：「汝莫輕彼人，

The Buddha said, "Do not underestimate others,

彼人若入定，

for if they enter meditation,

能以神力擲汝著他方世界。

they can use spiritual power to throw you into other worlds.

汝常不聞，

Have you not often heard,

我以無量方便，

that I, through countless means,

於梵行人所應起身口意行慈恭敬供養。

towards practitioners, should raise physical, verbal, and mental acts of kindness, respect, and offering.

此非法、非律、非如佛教，

This is neither lawful, nor in accordance with the precepts, nor as taught by the Buddha,

不可以是長養善法。

and cannot be used to cultivate good dharma.

從今日後不聽以掌刀相擬。」

From today onwards, using your palm as a knife is not allowed."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，

The Buddha told the monks, "Let all residing in the city of Shravasti gather,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。

and for the sake of ten benefits, I establish rules for the monks, that even those who have heard should listen again.

若比丘以掌刀擬比丘者，波夜提。」

Blade, the finger.




擬者，現打相。
The person drafting is now fighting mutually.




波夜提者，如上說。

A "Boddhisattva" is as explained above.




舉一指擬，波夜提。
Raising one finger is an offense called Prājñātyaya.

乃至五指亦如是。
Even raising five fingers is the same.

一切手指擬，波夜提。
Using any finger is considered Prājñātyaya.

拳擬，偷蘭遮。
Clenching a fist is a Stealing Sin.

掌刀擬比丘，波夜提；
Using a palm like a knife against a monk is Prājñātyaya;

比丘尼，偷蘭遮；
Against a nun, it's a Stealing Sin;

擬式叉摩尼、沙彌、沙彌尼，越毘尼罪。
Against Śikṣamāṇā, novices, and novices, it's a Vinaya transgression.

下至俗人，越毘尼心悔。
Even towards laypeople, one must repent for Vinaya violation.

若惡象馬牛羊狗，如是等種種惡獸來者，不得以掌刀擬。
If wicked animals like elephants, horses, cows, sheep, or dogs approach, one must not use the palm like a knife.

得以杖、木、瓦、石打地恐怖令去。
One may strike the ground with a stick, wood, tile, or stone to scare them away.

若是諸獸畜來入塔寺，壞諸形像及花果樹，亦得打地恐怖令去。
