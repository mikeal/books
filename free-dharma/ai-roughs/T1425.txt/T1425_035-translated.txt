佛住王舍城迦蘭陀竹園，爾時有比丘著多羅屐在坐禪比丘前經行，比丘心不得定。
The Buddha stayed in Karanda Bamboo Grove in Rajagaha city when a monk in wooden sandals walked in front of a meditating monk, causing the latter's mind to become unsettled.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks went to report this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼是比丘來。」來已，佛問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」
The Buddha said, "Call that monk here." When he came, the Buddha asked, "Is it true?" The monk replied, "Yes, it is true."

佛言：「從今已後應如是經行。云何如是？
The Buddha said, "From now on, walking should be done in this way. How is that?

不得在坐禪比丘前經行，眾僧前、徒眾前、和上阿闍梨前、長老比丘前經行。
Do not walk in front of meditating monks, the assembly of monks, disciples, preceptors, or elder monks.

若病服酥、服吐下藥，得在前經行。
If one is sick and taking ghee or purgatives, they may walk in front.

行時不得背迴，應面向右迴。
When walking, do not turn your back; you should face to the right.

若共和上、阿闍梨經行時，不得在前、不得共並，當隨後行。
If walking with a preceptor or teacher, do not go ahead or walk alongside; you should follow behind.

迴時不得先迴，應在後面向右迴。
When turning, do not turn first; you should turn to the right from the back.

不得在婬女前經行，摴蒱兒前、估酒前、屠肆前、獄卒前、殺人前；
Do not walk in front of prostitutes, gambling places, liquor shops, slaughterhouses, prison guards, or executioners;

不得深邃處經行，當在不深不淺處經行。
Do not walk in secluded places; you should walk in places that are neither too secluded nor too open.

經行法應如是。若不如是，越威儀法。」
The practice of walking should be like this. If not, it violates the rules of decorum."



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘在禪房中作駱駝坐。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, and at that time, six groups of monks sat in the meditation room in a camel-like posture.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks here."

來已，問言：「汝實爾不？」
When they arrived, he asked, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後不得作駱駝坐，應加趺坐。
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, do not sit in a camel-like posture, but should sit cross-legged.

若坐久寄極者，當互舒一脚，不得頓舒兩脚。
If you sit for a long time and feel extreme fatigue, you may stretch one leg at a time, but not both legs simultaneously.

若起經行，不得覆頭禪坊中坐。
If you rise for walking meditation, do not cover your head while sitting in the meditation hall.

若老病得覆半頭一耳，若屏處樹下覆頭無罪。
If you are old or sick, you may cover half your head and one ear; if you are in a secluded place under a tree, there is no fault in covering your head.

和上、阿闍梨、上座前，長老比丘若坐、若立，不得坐。
In front of preceptors, teachers, or senior monks, whether sitting or standing, you are not to sit.

不得在婬女前乃至深邃處坐，當在不深、不淺處坐。
Do not sit in front of women of ill repute, nor in secluded places; sit in places that are neither too deep nor too shallow.

比丘應如是坐，若不如是，越威儀法。」
Monks should sit in this manner; if not, they are violating the rules of conduct."




佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘伏臥、仰臥、左脇臥。
When the Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, at that time, six groups of monks lay on their stomachs, on their backs, and on their left sides.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks brought this matter up to the Exalted One.

佛言：「呼是比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call those monks here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」
When they came, he asked, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They answered, "It is true."

佛言：「從今已後當如是臥。云何臥？」
The Buddha said, "From now on, you should lie down in this manner. How should you lie down?"

不聽餓鬼臥、不聽阿脩羅臥、不聽貪欲人臥。
Do not lie down like a hungry ghost, an asura, or a covetous person.

若仰向者阿脩羅臥、覆地者餓鬼臥、左脇臥者貪欲人臥。
To lie on your back is the way of an asura, to lie prone is the way of a hungry ghost, to lie on the left side is the way of a covetous person.

比丘應如師子獸王顧身臥，敷時不聽左敷，應右敷，
A monk should lie like a lion king, and when spreading the mat, do not spread it on the left, but on the right.

頭向衣架，不得以脚向和上、阿闍梨、長老比丘。
Face the clothing rack, and do not point your feet towards the teacher, the preceptor, or the elder monks.

不得初夜便唱言噓極而臥，當正思惟自業，
Do not lie down right at the beginning of the night saying it is enough, but reflect on your deeds.

至中夜乃臥，以右脇著下如師子王臥，
At midnight, lie down on your right side like a lion king.

累兩脚、合口、舌柱上齗、枕右手舒左手順身上。
Stack your feet, close your mouth, place your tongue on the upper teeth, rest your head on the right hand and let the left hand lie along the body.

不捨念慧思惟起想，不得眠至日出，
Do not abandon mindfulness and wisdom and keep thoughts arising, do not sleep until sunrise.

至後夜當起正坐思惟己業，
In the last part of the night, rise and sit upright, reflecting on your deeds.

若夜惡眠不自覺轉者無罪。
If you experience poor sleep and turn unconsciously, there is no fault.

若老病、若右脇有癰瘡無罪。
If you are old or sick, or have a sore on the right side, there is no fault.

比丘臥法應如是，若不如是，越威儀法也。
The monk's way of lying down should be like this; if not, it transgresses the rules of proper conduct.



衣带帘障隔、  
Curtains and screens separate,

房舍及涕唾、  
The house and the tears,




鉢龕粥行住、

The bowl and shelf of congee during walking and standing,

坐臥三跋渠。

and during sitting and lying down, the three paths.



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘閉僧坊門共坐言談，

The Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī when six groups of monks closed the monastery gate and sat together talking.

客比丘來打門喚不聞，即便踰牆入。

A visiting monk came and knocked on the door, but was not heard, so he climbed over the wall to enter.

舊比丘問言：「長老從何處入？」

The resident monks asked, "Elder, where did you enter from?"

答言：「踰牆入。」

He replied, "I climbed over the wall to enter."

舊比丘言：「汝何故踰牆入？」

The resident monks said, "Why did you climb over the wall to enter?"

客比丘言：「汝何故閉門喚而不應？」

The visiting monk said, "Why did you close the door and not respond when I called?"

如是共諍。往白世尊，

Thus, they argued. They went to report to the Blessed One,

佛言：「從今已後不得閉門語話，亦不得踰牆而入。

The Buddha said, "From now on, you should not close the door to talk, nor climb over the wall to enter.

從今已後客比丘應如是，舊比丘應如是。

From now on, visiting monks should act like this, and resident monks should act like this.

云何如是？客比丘行時，應持戶鉤漉水囊針筒，

What is meant by like this? When the visiting monk travels, they should carry a door hook, a water filter, a needle case,

行伴一人有者一切無罪。

If just one of the companions possesses these items, there is no offense for any of them.

乃至都無者，舉眾有罪。

If no one possesses them, then everyone is at fault.

道路若有病者，當代擔衣鉢，不得在前遠去，應扶持而去。

If someone is sick along the way, you should carry their robes and bowl for them, not go far ahead, and should support them.

若不能行者，當借索乘致之。

If they cannot walk, you should arrange for a ride.

若道中有露濕者，年少當在前；

If the road is wet, younger monks should lead.

若畏賊虎狼時，老者應在中央；

If fearing thieves or wild animals, older monks should stay in the center.

若欲使賊起慈心者，應老者在前。

To inspire compassion in thieves, older monks should lead.

若經聚落路邊見有支提者，當按常道行，不得下道左旋右旋。

When passing by villages and seeing a stupa, you should follow the usual path, not veer left or right.

暮欲宿時，當先遣二年少比丘在前求宿處，索非時漿及塗足油、前食、後食。

In the evening, when seeking a place to stay, send two young monks ahead to find lodging and gather what's needed, like drinks or oils.

去者當著衣鉤紐，白非時入聚落，得已應還報言：

Those going should wear their robes properly, and upon entering the village after hours, they should report back,

『已得住處。』

"Shelter has been found."

若有池水井水，當澡浴著衣紐，展轉相白而入。

If there's a pool or well, bathe, wear robes properly, and inform others before entering.

若欲飲石蜜漿者當在外飲，勿使人生疑，呼出家人非時食。

If you wish to drink rock honey juice, drink outside to avoid suspicion of eating at improper times.

不得擔荷而入，當分衣物徐持共入。

No burden should be carried inside; share the load and enter slowly.

若得唱言隨所安者，後人不白入者無罪。

If it is announced that all are welcome, those coming later will not be at fault for not informing.

不得餘道去，若道上有覆無罪。

Do not take alternative routes unless obstructed; there will be no fault.

若聚落中有精舍者應往，若阿練若處者，邊有池水、井水亦應當澡洗而入。

Visit monasteries in villages, and bathe at pools or wells if near ascetic places before entering.

不得擔荷，

Do not carry burdens.

當共分張衣物脫革屣杖貫，若有支提者當右旋。

Share and lay out clothing and items; if near a stupa, circumambulate to the right.

不得高大語大聲入。

Do not enter with loud or boastful speech.

見舊比丘，不得唱：『咄！咄！汝故在此也。汝此中生、還此中死，不離此野干食。』

When you see resident monks, do not say, "Hey! You're still here. Born here, die here, never leaving this jackal's food."

舊比丘不得言：『咄！咄！如囚脫枷鎖已，四、五年不可得見。』

Resident monks should not say, "Hey! You're like a prisoner released from chains, unseen for four or five years."

客比丘不得言：『汝幾歲？我應得此房。』

Visiting monks should not say, "How old are you? I deserve this room."

不得問：『明日誰作前食、後食，有好食不？』

Do not ask, "Who is preparing meals tomorrow? Is there good food?"

舊比丘不得閉門語話。

Resident monks should not close the door to talk.

若欲舍後泥作及作餘事者，當使園民、若沙彌、維那、守門、若閉門者。

If you wish to do construction or other tasks, employ laypeople, novices, attendants, or gatekeepers.

客比丘不得踰牆而入，應持門鉤開入。

Visiting monks should not climb the wall to enter; use the door hook to open the gate.

若喚開門入已，舊比丘應問：『汝幾歲？』

When the door is opened upon request, resident monks should ask, "How old are you?"

應答言：『我爾許歲？』

They should respond, "I am of such an age."

舊比丘言：『若爾許歲者，得如是床褥。』

Resident monks should say, "If you are of such an age, you may have such a bed."

當問大小行處，不得臨時方問。

Ask about the size and location of places, not at the last moment.

次應問眾僧制限，

Next, inquire about the restrictions set by the monastic community,

舊比丘應語：『僧一切制限，某甲家覆鉢羯磨莫往、某甲家狗惡、某甲家不信。』

Resident monks should say, "The monks set all restrictions: do not visit certain households, some have mean dogs, some are unbelievers."

客比丘早起，不得便乞食去，應問：『是住處有前食後食不？』

Visiting monks should not rush to beg for food early; ask, "Is there breakfast and lunch here?"

舊比丘應語：『長老莫乞食，乞食疲苦或不如意，此中有前食後食。』

Resident monks should say, "Elder, do not beg for food; it is tiring or unsatisfying. There is breakfast and lunch here."

若行伴已去者，不得語言：『長老！賈客已去故可及。』

If companions have departed, do not say, "Elder! The traders have left, so catch up!"

應語：『長老！可小停息，正爾復有伴耳。』

Say instead, "Elder, please rest briefly; another companion will soon arrive."

若有急事必欲去者，應給糧食囑累行伴。

If urgent matters require departure, provide food and advise companions.

如是客比丘、舊比丘法當如是。

Thus, the rules for visiting and resident monks should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法。」

If not followed, it violates the principles. 




佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti,

爾時六群比丘洗脚而並俗話弄水。

At that time, six groups of monks were washing their feet and casually playing with water.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。

The monks, on this occasion, went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後洗脚應當如舍利弗法也。」

The Buddha said, "From today onwards, when washing feet, it should be done according to the way of Shariputra."




佛住王舍城迦蘭陀竹園，

The Buddha resided in the Bamboo Grove Monastery in Rajagaha.

時舍利弗著入聚落衣，持鉢入城次行乞食，

At that time, Sariputta donned his robe and, carrying his bowl, entered the city to beg for food.

威儀庠審來去視瞻，屈伸俯仰著衣持鉢，

With dignified and composed deportment, he walked, looking around, bending and stretching, wearing his robe and carrying his bowl.

守攝諸根心不外亂，似得妙法潤澤之相。

He guarded his senses and maintained an unperturbed mind, resembling one who has attained the gentle state of sublime teaching.

婆羅門見已作是念：「是沙門釋子在於人間現持威儀，

A Brahmin upon seeing him thought, "This monk from the Shakya clan possesses such dignity among men,

至屏處已必無法則，我當逐看。

but when he reaches a secluded place, he will surely abandon decorum. I shall follow him to see.

若見放恣，當以手拍頭。」

If I see him lose his restraint, I shall slap my head in disappointment."

即便尋後。

So he followed behind.

於是舍利弗在聚落中及阿練若處威儀不改。

Thus, Sariputta maintained his demeanor in the settlement and throughout the forest without change.

到住處已持鉢置一處，

Upon reaching his dwelling, he placed his bowl in one spot.

抖擻僧伽梨襞褻置常處。

He shook out his robe and folded it neatly in its usual place.

敷坐床、持洗脚板及甖水自近而坐，

He prepared a seat, brought the foot-washing board and water container nearby, and sat down.

復取革屣抖擻放地，

He took off his sandals, shook them, and placed them on the ground.

次取巾拭膞，還取革屣以底相搭合捉，

Then he took a cloth to wipe his knees, picked up the sandals again, aligning the soles and holding them together,

以巾拂之。

and brushed them with the cloth.

次以水漬巾，拭一隻革屣鼻及綱紐，

Next, he wet the cloth with water, and wiped the toe-caps and straps of one sandal,

次拭根；

then wiped the base;

次拭第二者亦如是。

and similarly cleaned the second one.

還復拭初捉者脚指處，次拭脚跟處；

He then wiped the toe area and heel of the first one again;

還拭第二者亦爾。

and did the same for the second one.

次浣巾捩已曬之，次洗手。

Then he washed the cloth, wrung it out to dry, and washed his hands.

洗手已以右手瀉水，左手洗左膞，

After washing his hands, he poured water with his right hand and washed his left knee with his left hand,

次洗右膞，次洗脚。

next washing his right knee, and then his feet.

婆羅門見已發歡喜心言：「尊者淨潔如是，

The Brahmin, upon seeing this, felt joy and said, "The Venerable One is so pure and clean,

此殘水亦當可飲，我婆羅門事淨水法不及是淨。」

I could even drink this leftover water. My Brahmin practice of pure water cannot compare to this purity."

時舍利弗因婆羅門發歡喜心而為說法，得法眼淨。

At that time, Sariputta, seeing the Brahmin's joyful mind, preached the Dharma, and he attained the purity of the Dharma eye.



諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！甚善。

The monks said to the Buddha, "World-honored One! Very good.

婆羅門見舍利弗洗脚威儀淨故發歡喜心，乃至如是。」

The Brahmin saw Sariputra's composed demeanor while washing his feet and was pleased, even to this extent."

佛言：「非但今日歡喜，過去世時已曾如是，如《生經》中廣說。」

The Buddha said, "Not only is he pleased today, but it was also so in past lives, as extensively told in the Jataka tales.

爾時長者子，舍利弗是；

At that time, the elder's son was Sariputra;

爾時賊者，今婆羅門是。

At that time, the robber was the current Brahmin.

時諸天見已而說偈言：

And then, the deities, having seen this, spoke verses:




淨潔好威儀，
With pure and dignified demeanor,

因是得善利，
Because of this, one obtains good fortune.




如水淨影現，　　
As the reflection in clear water appears,

學威儀最勝。
Learning the most excellent conduct.



來時懷惡心，
Came with a malicious heart,

既見反歡喜，
But returned with joy.



不學善威儀，

If you do not learn good manners,

必為賊所害。

you will surely be harmed by thieves.




中還時，應脫入聚落衣抖擻襞褻著常處，著園中衣、敷坐床聚洗脚板，盛水甖自近，以巾拂脚塵土。
When a monk returns to the village, he should take off his village garment, shake and fold it neatly, don the garden robe, spread a mat, and gather the foot-washing board, bringing the water vessel close by, and use a cloth to dust off the dirt from the feet.

次捉革屣以底相搭，持巾拂之，次漬巾拭一隻鼻綱紐，次拭根、次拭第二隻亦如是。
Then, take up his leather shoes, one foot on top of the other, and wipe them with a cloth, then moisten a cloth to clean the strap of one shoe, followed by the sole, and then do the same for the other shoe.

還復取初捉者，先拭脚指間，次拭脚跟處，次拭第二者亦爾。
He then takes the first shoes again, first wiping between the toes, next wiping the heel area, and then does the same for the second pair.

次浣巾絞捩曬之，莫使塵生蟲食，然後洗手。
Next, rinse the cloth, wring it out, and hang it to dry, preventing dust or insects from affecting it, and then wash the hands.

若水器在右邊，應先洗左膞、次洗右膞、然後洗脚，不得以捉水手揩脚，應一手瀉水一手摩。
If the water container is on the right side, first wash the left arm, then the right arm, and then the feet; one should not use the hand holding the water to rub the feet, but rather use one hand to pour the water and the other to rub.

若二人者，一人澆一人洗，不得太多用水棄，當籌量用。
If two people are involved, one pours and the other washes, they should not use excessive water or waste it and should measure their use carefully.

不得覆頭覆右肩，當偏袒坐。
One should not completely cover their head or right shoulder, but should sit with one shoulder bared.

不得洗脚時坐禪、睡眠、不淨觀及誦經，竟當避去勿妨餘人。
During foot washing, one should not meditate, sleep, engage in impurity contemplation, or recite sutras, and afterward, one should leave and not disturb others.

若最在後洗者，得誦經無罪。
If one is the last to wash, they may recite sutras without fault.

若水盡者，不得默然置之，當語知水家令益。
If the water is exhausted, one should not remain silent but inform the householder to add more water.

若不能者，乃至自益一澡罐水，使得一人用直。
If unable to inform, one should add at least one pot of water to enable another person to use it properly.

洗脚法應如是。
The method of washing feet should be as such.

若不如是，越威儀法也。
If not done this way, it violates the rules of etiquette


佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘洗脚，濕脚著革屣，革屣染色脫著脚，污僧床褥。
The Buddha resided in Śrāvastī, at that time six groups of monks washed their feet, put on wet shoes, stained the shoes and then removed them, dirtying the monks' mats.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks, due to this matter, went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼六群比丘來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of monks."

來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」
After they came, the Buddha asked the monks, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
They replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「從今日已後洗脚時應如是。
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, when washing feet it should be done like this.

當竪革屣耳令脚乾已，乃著革屣。
The shoes should be placed upright and the feet allowed to dry before putting on the shoes.

若多人待者，當以手捋水、以巾拭之，然後著革屣。
If many people are waiting, they should wipe the water with their hands and a cloth before putting on the shoes.

不得以濕脚蹈僧淨好作地，當令燥已乃入。
Do not step on the clean monks' area with wet feet, it should be dry before entering.

若是一人洗處者，不應拭，當待燥已著革屣。
If it is an individual washing place, there should be no wiping, wait until dry to put on shoes.

應護塵土，若急欲坐禪誦經經行者，乃至手拭巾拂塵土而去。
Dust should be protected, for those eager to meditate or recite scriptures, they should brush off the dust with a hand towel.

洗脚法應如是。
The method of washing feet should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法。
If not done this way, it violates the rules of propriety.



，爾時僧淨水蔓荼羅，諸比丘取水洗脚洗手面洗鉢，用已繚繫瓮頭印封戶，而入聚落乞食。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī when the monks created a pure water mandala, took water to wash their feet, hands, faces, and bowls, tied the mouth of the jar with a seal, and went into the village to beg for food.

後有客比丘來，瞋嫌言：「何故閉淨水、屋印封而去？」
Later, a visiting monk came and angrily questioned, "Why did you seal the pure water and the house and leave?"

時諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，乃至佛言：「從今已後春月當如是安水。
At that time, the monks, because of this matter, went to the Blessed One and the Buddha said, "From now on, in the spring months, you should prepare the water like this.

若大瓮、小瓮、若瓶，當以淨物覆口、以繩繚繫之。
For large or small jars or bottles, cover the mouth with a clean object and tie it with a rope.

若瓦、若石、若木作蓋覆上，內應置𢍶水器，水中應著波多梨華、瞻婆華、須摩那華，如是比令水香美。
If a lid made of tile, stone, or wood is used, place a water container inside, and put Padma flowers, Candana flowers, or Sumana flowers in the water, making the water fragrant and pleasant.

有名水：如巴連弗邑有輸奴水、王舍城有溫泉水、波羅奈城有佛遊行池水、瞻婆國有恒水、舍衛城有石蜜水、沙祇國有懸注水、僧伽施國有石蜜水、摩偷羅國有遙扶那水，如是比水不聽洗脚手面及鉢。
There are renowned waters: like Śūnu water in the city of Bālarākṣā, hot spring water in the city of Rājagṛha, the pool water where the Buddha walked in Vārāṇasī, constant water in the country of Candana, stone honey water in Śrāvastī, suspended water in Śākya, stone honey water in Saṅghasya, and far-carrying water in Mathurā. Such waters are not allowed for washing feet, hands, face, or bowls.

若病須水應與滿鉢。
If a sick person needs water, they should be given a full bowl.

若食上欲行水者，當先淨水洗手洗器然後行水。
If you want to serve water with food, you must first clean water, wash your hands, and clean the vessels before serving water.

受水人當護左手令淨受水，若手污者當澆；若以葉承取，亦用葉拭膩口。
The person receiving the water should protect their left hand to receive the water cleanly. If the hand is dirty, pour water on it; if using a leaf to catch the water, also use a leaf to wipe the mouth's oil.

飲時不得沒脣、不得使器緣著額，當拄脣而飲。
During drinking, do not immerse your lips, and do not let the rim of the vessel touch your forehead. Hold it against your lips while drinking.

飲時不得盡飲，當留少許，掏盪已從口處棄之。
When drinking, do not finish it all, leave a little, and after rinsing, discard it from the mouth.

行水人當好護淨器，若見沒脣著額者，當放置一處，以草作識令人知不淨，若能以水洗者可更行。
The person serving water should carefully protect the clean vessels. If they see someone immerse their lips or let the rim touch their forehead, they should set it aside, mark it with grass to signal impurity, and, if it can be cleaned with water, allow it to be reused.

若非時行飲者，行飲人先淨洗手洗器而行，受飲人亦應淨洗手受。
If serving drinks at an inappropriate time, the server should first wash hands and vessels clean and then serve, and the recipient should also wash hands before receiving.

若不洗者，當以葉、若淨衣承器底受如上，乃至口處棄。
If not washed, use leaves or clean clothes to hold the base of the vessel as mentioned above, then discard from the mouth.

若浴室中行飲者，當以葉承器底拄脣而飲，餘如上說。

如是名好水，不得用洗脚手面盪鉢，亦不得作餘用、棄之。
Such is called good water, and it should not be used for washing feet, hands, face, or bowls; nor should it be used for other purposes or discarded.

若有作衣鉢事須者，可權貸用還償。
If there is a need for robe or bowl work, it may be temporarily used and repaid.

Water should be used in this way, and if not, it violates the etiquette."




佛住王舍城耆域童子菴婆羅園。
The Buddha was residing in the Bamboo Grove within the young prince's park of Rajagaha.

爾時耆域童子往至佛所，頭面禮足却住一面，
At that time, the young prince went to the Buddha, bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, and stood to one side.

白佛言：「世尊！願聽諸比丘溫室浴，能除冷陰得安樂住。」
He said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One! I wish you would permit the monks to bathe in warm rooms, to remove the cold and dwell in comfort."

佛言：「聽溫室浴。」
The Buddha said, "I permit bathing in warm rooms."




衛城，爾時世尊聽溫室浴，

Furthermore, when the Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī, the World-Honored One permitted the use of a heated room for bathing.

時六群比丘聞打洗浴揵椎時，便先入浴室，

At that time, six groups of monks, upon hearing the signal for bathing, went ahead into the bathhouse.

頓著薪炭已，閉戶取汗而住。

They quickly set the firewood and charcoal, closed the door, and stayed inside to perspire.

外比丘索開戶，不肯與開，而言：「諸長老！且住待火然。」

Monks outside asked to open the door, but they refused, saying, "Venerable ones! Stay put and wait for the fire to burn."

便多用。薪炭屑水都盡，方開戶而喚言：「諸長老可入。」

They used a lot, and only after all the firewood, charcoal, and water were consumed did they open the door and say, "Venerable ones, you may enter."

諸比丘既入，復於外閉戶。

Once the monks entered, they closed the door from the outside again.

諸比丘熱悶喚索開戶，答言：「長老！且住取汗，能愈疥癬。」

The monks, feeling hot and stuffy, called to open the door, but were answered with, "Venerable ones! Stay put and sweat, it can cure scabies."

而復於外用水屑都盡，以器覆地然後開戶言：「長老可出。」

They again used up all the water and charcoal, covering the ground with containers before opening the door and saying, "Venerable ones, you may exit."

出已熱悶求水，復語言：「長老！稍用，如世尊所說，乃至水亦當節量用。」

Once outside, feeling hot and seeking water, they were told, "Venerable ones! Use sparingly, as the World-Honored One has said, even water should be used in moderation."

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，

Because of this event, the monks went to report to the World-Honored One.

乃至佛言：「浴室應如是作，浴法應如是。」

The Buddha instructed, "The bathhouse should be constructed like this, and the bathing procedure should be conducted in such a manner."

浴室應方作、若圓作，當安戶作向，

The bathhouse can be constructed square or round, and the door should be set accordingly.

向法內寬外小，若一、若二安開向物通烟道。

The interior should be spacious while the exterior small, with one or two open ventilation paths for smoke.

屋內應以塼石砌底作竈，令底廣上狹，去地半肘，

Inside, a stove of bricks and stones should be made, with a broad base and narrow top, half an elbow above the ground.

通烟道邊安火朼。

Beside the smoke channel, arrange the hearth wood.

若竈在右邊，左邊安戶扇；若在左邊，右邊安戶扇。

If the stove is on the right, place the door panel on the left; if on the left, place it on the right.

短作戶扂令易開閉。

Make the door fastener short for easy opening and closing.

前應作衣屋，安龍牙撅懸衣處。

A cloakroom should be made in front, with dragon-teeth pegs for hanging clothes.

若欲浴時，使園民先掃屋間塵埃蟲網，以水灑地淨掃。

When preparing to bathe, the garden keeper should first sweep dust and spider webs, sprinkle water, and clean the ground.

應辦薪炭釜鑊瓫瓮，先安薪炭然後打揵椎，

Gather firewood, charcoal, pots, pans, bowls, and jars; set the firewood and charcoal before sounding the signal.

不得太早著火令然盡乃打揵椎。

Do not light the fire too early such that it burns out before sounding the signal.

打揵椎時，應知為浴一切僧、為浴徒眾、為別屋？

When sounding the signal, know whether it's for all monks to bathe, for laypersons, or for another room.

隨事應去。

Proceed accordingly.

若一切浴者，應次第去，

If it's for all to bathe, take turns to go.

應各自以腰帶繫衣作識安衣架上。

Each should use a waist belt to tie and mark their clothes on the rack.

入時不得掉兩臂而入，一手遮前而入，一人入一人出。

When entering, do not swing both arms; enter with one hand in front, and let one person in as another exits.

有後入者，先人應與處。

If others follow, the first ones should give space.

不得越器物及長老比丘上過，當徐徐入。

Do not overstep utensils or senior monks; enter slowly.

若和上、阿闍梨在內者，不得在外待言：『何時出？』

If the preceptor or teacher is inside, do not wait outside asking, "When will you come out?"

應當脫衣入與揩洗。

Undress and enter to wash along with them.

若欲與人揩者，當白和上、阿闍梨，

If you wish someone to scrub you, inform the preceptor or teacher.

若先白者無罪。

If informed first, there is no fault.

若火熾者，年少當近火；若火弱者，長老應近。

If the fire is strong, the young should be near it; if weak, the elders should be closer.

當徐徐用水，不得污濺邊人。

Use water slowly, without splashing others.

若弟子揩時，不得一時舉兩手，

When disciples scrub, they should not raise both hands at once.

當先令揩一臂，

First, let one arm be scrubbed.

一手覆前，竟已次揩一臂。

Cover the front with one hand, then the other arm is scrubbed in turn.

內水已，閉戶而坐令身汗。

Once water is drawn, sit with the door closed to allow sweating.

當行油，若以盞子、若以手等行，屑末亦爾。

Apply oil with a cup or hand, while also rubbing powder in the same manner.

若檀越言：『自恣與。』當籌量用水若甖量。

If the patron permits, measure and use water intelligently.

分用者，當齊所得器，不得長用餘分。

Those using shared portions should align their usage with what they receive, without overusing.

若言：『各自辦水。』者，有水者得入，無者不得入。

If told, "Prepare your own water," only those with water may enter.

若有弟子言：『和上、阿闍梨但入，我當與水。』

If a disciple says, "Preceptor, just enter; I'll provide water,"

亦當籌量用。

they too should use it judiciously.

若優婆塞園民言：『但入，我當與水。』

If a layperson or garden keeper says, "Just enter, I'll provide water,"

若坐水中至臍亦得。

sitting in water up to the navel is also permissible.

出已，自取衣著，他衣正理而去。

Once finished, take your own clothes, arrange others’ clothes properly, and leave.

洗浴已若直欲去，應語園民，

After bathing, if leaving directly, inform the garden keeper,

應舉浴器物。

who should then remove bathing equipment.

若比丘後來言：『長老但去，我自舉。』者，

If a monk later says, "Venerable, just go, I'll remove it,"

應去。後者摒擋舉物覆火。

you may leave. The latter is to manage the items and cover the fire.

浴法應如是。若不如是，越威儀法也。」

This is how bathing should be conducted. Failure to follow this is a breach of proper conduct.


佛住舍衛城，爾時世尊五日一行諸比丘房，見淨厨器物處處狼藉，佛知而故問：「是何器物狼藉乃爾？」

Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, and at that time, the World Honored One visited the monks' quarters every five days, witnessing the kitchen utensils scattered everywhere. Buddha, knowing this, purposely asked, "Why are these utensils so scattered?"

乃至佛言：「從今日後不得令器物縱橫如是。」

And then Buddha said, "From today onwards, do not allow the utensils to be so disorganized."

若摩摩帝、若直月，當使園民、若沙彌摒擋。

Whether it is during the waxing or waning moon, the garden workers or novices should arrange them neatly.

若摩摩帝、若直月不用意見者，便應使淨人摒擋，

If during the waxing or waning moon nobody pays attention, then the cleaners should arrange them.

若銅鐵、釜鑊、銚器，應使淨人淨洗，

Copper and iron utensils, cauldrons, and pots should be cleaned by the cleaners.

以泥塗上覆著淨厨屋內，若瓦釜銚鑊亦爾。

They should be coated with clay and stored inside the clean kitchen, and this applies to clay pots as well.

覆地以塼瓦鎮之，木瓫木杓亦應洗淨舉之。

The ground should be covered with tiles to secure them, and wooden pots and ladles should also be cleaned and stored.

若簟席當應日曬懸舉竹篋，

If there are mats and seats, they should be sunned and stored in bamboo baskets.

簸箕、漉米箕亦應懸舉勿使蟲噉，

Winnowing baskets and rice sieves should also be stored to prevent bugs from eating them.

飯篋、飯朼淨洗懸舉，

Rice boxes and utensils for serving food should be cleaned and stored.

用已當摒擋著常處，

After use, they should be neatly arranged and stored in their usual places.

後人須者取易得，不致疲苦。

Future users should be able to find them easily without effort.

若須用者當與，若二人一時索者，當先與上座。

Anyone needing to use them should be given access, and if two people request at the same time, it should first be given to the senior monk.

若上座用久，年少小用者，當先與年少。

If the senior monk has been using it for a long time and a younger monk needs it, it should be given to the younger one first.

若二人俱小用者，當先與上座。

If two young monks need it, it should be given to the senior monk first.

器物法應如是。若不如是，越威儀法也。」

The rule for managing utensils should be thus. If not followed, it violates the decorum.




，

The Buddha was staying in the city of Śrāvastī.

爾時眾多比丘共一房住，

At that time, many monks were living together in one room.

時有比丘衣架上自取衣，

Once, a monk was taking his robe from the clothes rack,

拽他衣墮地，

and pulled another's robe to the ground.

餘比丘夜出大小行，

Other monks went out at night to relieve themselves,

脚蹈衣上。

and stepped on the robes.

衣主求衣不見，

The owner of the robe searched for it but could not find it,

乃至於地得之。

until he found it on the ground.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。

The monks reported this incident to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今已後衣應如是。

The Buddha said, "From now on, robes should be handled in this way.

若眾多人共一房住者，

If many people are living together in one room,

衣應各自襞褻以葉著內。

each should fold their robes and place them inside with leaves.

若他衣架上，

If using another's clothes rack,

以腰繩繫之，

tie it with a waistband.

復不得持和上衣、阿闍梨衣裹己衣，

You must not wrap your robe with the preceptor's or teacher's robe.

當持己衣覆和上、阿闍梨衣。

Instead, cover the preceptor's or teacher's robe with your own.

若春時多塵土者，

If in spring there is much dust,

當持己衣覆上。

cover it with your robe.

若夏地濕者，

If the ground is wet in summer,

當持己衣著下。

place your robe below.

Regard your robe as your skin.

衣法應如是，

The method of handling robes should be like this,

若不如是，

If not,

越威儀法。」

it violates the code of conduct."

The fourth section ends here.




佛住舍衛城，爾時聚落比丘、阿練若比丘共一施，時阿練若比丘常以時來，聚落比丘忽早打揵椎而食。

The Buddha resided in Śrāvastī, at that time village monks and forest monks shared offerings, and the forest monks would come regularly, but the village monks unexpectedly rang the bell early to eat.

阿練若比丘日時欲至方到，問言：「打揵椎未？」答言：「已食竟。」

The forest monk arrived as scheduled and asked, "Has the bell been rung?" The reply was, "We have already eaten."

時阿練若還去，明便早來盡持食去。

The forest monk returned, and the next day came early and took all the food away.

聚落比丘來索食，淨人言：「阿練若比丘已盡持去。」

The village monks came to ask for food, and the attendants said, "The forest monk has already taken it all."

聚落比丘言：「長老何故早起來盡持食去？」

The village monk said, "Elder, why did you come early and take all the food?"

阿練若言：「汝何故早起打揵椎食，不待我耶？」

The forest monk replied, "Why did you ring the bell and eat early without waiting for me?"

二人共諍，往至佛所以是因緣具白世尊。

The two argued and went to the Buddha to report the full story.

佛言：「從今日後阿練若比丘應如是，聚落比丘應如是。」

The Buddha said, "From today on, forest monks should do this, and village monks should do this."

云何如是？若阿練若比丘、聚落比丘共一施者，聚落中比丘不得早起打揵椎，前食後食及差請食，應待阿練若。

What does this mean? If both forest monks and village monks share offerings, the village monks should not ring the bell early or eat before the forest monks, and they should wait for the forest monk.

阿練若比丘不得言：『我徐徐往，自當待我。』應先往。

The forest monk should not say, 'I will go slowly, you should wait for me.' They should go first.

若倩人請分，若囑留坐處，聚落比丘應問：『阿練若比丘來未？』

If a person is asked to reserve a portion or save a seat, the village monks should ask, 'Has the forest monk arrived?'

若倩人迎食，若囑留坐處，應示處。

If a person is assigned to receive food or save a seat, it should be indicated where.

若優婆塞請僧者，聚落比丘應語阿練若比丘言：『長老！明日早來，某甲請前食後食，莫餘乞食。』

If a lay devotee invites the monks, the village monks should inform the forest monk, 'Elder! Come early tomorrow, someone invites for special offering; do not ask for other food.'

阿練若比丘聞已當早來，來已若食未熟者不得守住，應禮塔、誦經、問法。

After hearing this, the forest monk should come early, and if the food is not ready upon arrival, they should not stay idly, but instead, worship the stupa, recite scriptures, or ask about the Dharma.

聚落比丘應先釜中著水然火，待至然後著米。

The village monks should first put water in the pot and light the fire, then wait until the forest monk arrives to add the rice.

阿練若比丘或有鬼難、水火賊難不得來者而棄米。

If the forest monk encounters ghostly disturbances or dangers like thieves, water or fire, and cannot come, then the rice should be discarded.

若飲食已熟者，檀越欲打揵椎，當語：『長壽！日故尚早，可待阿練若至。』

If the food is ready and the supporter wishes to ring the bell, he should say, 'Venerable one! The time is still early, we can wait for the forest monk.'

若日時逼者應打揵椎。

If it is approaching midday, then the bell should be rung.

阿練若應以樹、若牆壁影作准，則知日早晚應來。

The forest monk should use shadows of trees or walls as a reference to know the correct time to come.

設未來者，當留坐處。

If the monk has not arrived, a seat should be reserved.

若阿練若處作食者，亦應如是。

If the food is prepared at the forest monk's place, the same rules apply.

阿練若比丘不應輕聚落中比丘言：『汝必利舌頭少味而在此住。』

The forest monk should not disparage village monks by saying, 'You must enjoy the taste and stay here for it.'

應讚：『汝聚落中住，說法教化、為法作護，覆蔭我等。』

Instead, they should praise, 'You live in the village, preaching and teaching, protecting the Dharma, providing us shelter.'

聚落比丘不應輕阿練若言：『汝在阿練若處住，希望名利，麞鹿禽獸亦在阿練若處住。

The village monk should not disparage forest monks by saying, 'You live in the forest hoping for fame and profit, as do the deer and beasts.'

汝在阿練若處，從朝竟日正可數歲數月耳。』

'You live in the forest, which can take days and months to reach.'

應讚言：『汝遠聚落在阿練若處，閑靜思惟上業所崇，此是難行之處，能於此住而息心意。』

They should praise, 'You live far from the village in the forest, calmly contemplating higher deeds, a difficult place to stay and calm your mind.'

阿練若應如是，聚落比丘應如是。

This is how forest monks and village monks should behave.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」

If not followed, it violates the code of conduct."



佛住舍衛城，爾時舊比丘共諍口，有客比丘來接足而禮。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti, and at that time, an old monk had a dispute with others. A guest monk came and bowed to him.

後日客比丘來復禮問言：「汝來幾日？」
Later, the guest monk came back and asked, "How long have you been here?"

答言：「四五日。」
He replied, "Four or five days."

舊比丘言：「汝來爾許日，何以不見我？」
The old monk said, "You have been here for so long, why haven't you seen me?"

答言：「我已見禮竟，長老共諍口故不見我耳。」
He replied, "I have already paid my respects. I didn't see you because you were quarreling."

舊比丘言：「汝何以見我共諍而向我禮？」
The old monk said, "Why did you pay respects to me while I was quarreling?"

答言：「汝何以共諍不視我禮耶？」
The guest monk replied, "Why did you not notice my respects while you were quarreling?"

二人便共諍，往至佛所，乃至佛言：「從今日後應如是禮，應如是相問訊。
The two quarreled and went to the Buddha, who then said, "From now on, here is how you should pay respects and inquire.

云何如是禮、如是問訊？
How should you show such respect and inquiry?

前人共諍共語時不得禮，當低頭小敬。
When two are quarreling or talking, do not pay respects; just bow your head slightly.

前人若止，應作禮。
When they stop, then you should pay respects.

若屋作泥作時不應禮，如是一切作，
When working with clay or building, respects should not be paid; in all such tasks,

不得禮膝、禮脚、禮脛，當接足禮。
Do not bow only to knees, feet, or legs; you should pay full respects.

若前人脚上有瘡，當護勿𢴤觸。
If the person ahead has sores on their feet, take care not to touch them.

受禮人不得如瘂羊不語，當相問訊。
The person receiving respect should not remain silent like a mute sheep; inquires should be made.

問訊時不得作如是語：『何處有多美飲食？』
When inquiring, do not ask, 'Where is good food?'

應問：『少病、少惱、安樂不？道路不疲苦耶？』
You should ask, 'Are you free from illness and trouble, are you well? Was your journey tiring?'

客比丘應問：『何者是僧上座？第二、第三上座？』應禮足。
The guest monk should ask, 'Who is the senior monk, the second most senior, and the third?' Then pay respects.

舊比丘應問：『長老幾歲？』
The old monk should ask, 'How old are you, elder?'

若客比丘小者，應與座令坐。
If the guest monk is young, offer them a seat.

若有者應與前食、後食、塗足油、非時漿。
Offer food, oil for feet, and drinks when appropriate.

客比丘、舊比丘應如是。
Both guest monks and old monks should do this.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」
If not done, it violates the rules of decorum."



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘展轉作俗人相喚，阿翁、阿母、阿兄、阿弟。
When the Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, at that time, six groups of monks informally addressed each other as father, mother, elder brother, younger brother.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks due to this reason went to report to the Blessed One.

佛問六群比丘：「汝實爾不？」
The Buddha asked the six groups of monks, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後應如是共語問訊。
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you should address each other as follows for greetings.

共翁語時不得喚言：『阿翁、阿爺、摩訶羅。』

語法應如是。
The language should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」
If not like this, it violates the rules of conduct.



佛住舍衛城，爾時剎利眾集欲有所論，時難陀、優波難陀先到而坐。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, and at that time, the kshatriya group gathered for a discussion, with Nanda and Upananda arriving first and taking seats.

時諸人嫌言：「我等今集欲有所論，而此沙門妨我議論事。」
At that time, the people complained, "We have gathered here for a discussion, but these monks are hindering our debate."

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，乃至佛言：「從今日後當如是入剎利眾。」
Because of this situation, the monks went to the World-Honored One and told him, and the Buddha said, "From today onwards, you should enter the kshatriya group in this manner."

云何如是入剎利眾？
How should you enter the kshatriya group?

若有事緣應往，當先語其中大者道來情事。
If there is a matter that needs attending, you should first mention it to the elders there.

若言：『可來。』應往。
If they say, 'You may come,' you should go.

不得持傘蓋著革屣，入時應脫著一處。
Do not carry an umbrella or wear shoes; you should take them off and place them at one spot upon entering.

不得言：『男子樂不？』
Do not say, 'Are you enjoying yourselves?'

若示坐處應坐，不得毀譽軍陣鬪法。
If a seat is indicated, you should sit; do not criticize or praise military formations or battle strategies.

若見好射不得稱讚，
If you see good archery, do not give praise,

應言：『剎利種是上姓，如來、應供、正遍知常在二家生。』
Instead, say, "The kshatriya caste is of a superior lineage, and the Tathāgata, the Blessed One, the Fully Enlightened, is often born in both families.

剎利、婆羅門家有二種輪：法輪、力輪，諸出家人賴力輪護故得以自安。』
The kshatriyas and brahmins have two kinds of wheels: the Wheel of Dharma and the Wheel of Power, and monks depend on the protection of the Wheel of Power to live in peace."

欲有論事說已當去。
After discussing the matter, leave.

入剎利眾應如是。
You should enter the kshatriya group in this manner.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」
If not done in this way, it would violate the rules of conduct."



佛住舍衛城

The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī.

爾時婆羅門眾集

At that time, a group of Brahmins gathered.

難陀、優波難陀先至而坐

Nanda and Upananda arrived first and sat down.

諸婆羅門嫌言：「我等欲有所論，而此沙門妨廢我等事。」

The Brahmins complained, "We want to discuss something, but these ascetics are interrupting us."

乃至佛言：「從今日後應如是入婆羅門眾。」

Then the Buddha said, "From today onwards, one should enter the assembly of Brahmins in this way."

若有事緣欲至往時，當先語其中大者道其事情，若聽者應往。

If there is a matter to be discussed and you wish to go, first speak to the most senior among them and explain the situation. If they agree, then you may go.

未至時當屏傘蓋脫革屣，不得見已方却。

Before you arrive, remove your parasol and sandals in private; do not retreat just upon seeing them.

又不得借蓋革屣往，不得言：「樂不？男子！」

Do not borrow their parasol and sandals to go, and do not say, "Are you happy, man?"

不得毀譽天祠，不得形相婆羅門多我慢故，

Do not criticize or praise the deities' offerings, and do not display arrogance towards the Brahmins.

當生六趣若雞、若猪、若狗、若野干、駝驢、地獄中。

One might be reborn in one of the six paths, as a chicken, pig, dog, jackal, camel, donkey, or in hell.

應言：「如來、應供、正遍知，二種姓家生，若剎利家、若婆羅門家。」

One should say, "The Tathagata, worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, is born in two kinds of families, either a Kshatriya or a Brahmin family."

欲有所論當說已而去。

If you wish to discuss something, speak first and then leave.

入婆羅門眾法應如是。

This is how one should conduct themselves when entering the Brahmin assembly.

若不如是，越威儀法。

If one does not do so, they violate the rules of proper conduct.



，乃至佛言：「從今日後入居士眾，若有緣應往，乃至示坐處而坐。

The Buddha stayed in Śrāvastī, and the Buddha said, "From today onward, when you enter the laity gathering, if there is a reason to go, you should proceed and sit where shown.

不得言：『汝淨洗手脚、坐於店肆，用輕稱小斗欺誑於人，甚於盜賊。』

Do not say: 'You wash your hands and feet clean, sit in the shop, use light weights and measures to cheat people, worse than thieves.'

應言：『有二種輪：法輪、食輪，得食輪已乃轉法輪。

You should say: 'There are two kinds of wheels: the Dharma wheel and the food wheel. Once you get the food wheel, you can turn the Dharma wheel.

如世尊說告諸比丘：「婆羅門居士供給衣食臥具疾病湯藥，饒益甚多，是難為事。」

As the World Honored One told the monks: "The Brahmin lay-folk who provide clothing, food, bedding, and medicines for illness benefit greatly; it is a difficult task."

我依汝等，在如來法中修梵行度生死流，皆是汝等信心之恩。』

Relying on you, I practice the holy path in the Tathagata's teaching to transcend the flow of birth and death; it is all due to your faith-based kindness.'

若有所論言已而去。入居士眾應如是。

Once you have said this and leave, entering the laity gathering should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」

If not, it would be against the decorum regulations."



，乃至佛言：「入外道眾應如是。
The Buddha resided in Sravasti, and then spoke: "Entering the company of non-believers should be like this.

云何如是？乃至示坐處已應坐，不得毀譽彼見。
What does this mean? After showing your seat, you should sit down without disparaging or praising their views.

又不得形呰言：『汝等邪見不信、無慚無愧。』
Nor should you criticize by saying: 'You hold wrong views, are unbelieving, and lack shame and guilt.'

應譽其實事：『汝等能出家解繫縛、捨於俗服、冥心空閑，甚是難事。』
You should praise their genuine actions: 'You are able to renounce, break free from attachments, abandon worldly clothes, and have a calm mind, which is very difficult.'

如是得稱一切實事，不得說其過，若欲論事言已便去。
In this way, you commend all genuine actions and should not speak of their faults; once you have spoken about matters, you should leave.

入外道眾法應如是。
The proper conduct when entering the company of non-believers should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」
If not done this way, it transgresses the rules of conduct."



佛住舍衛城，乃至佛言：「從今日後應如是入眾。

The Buddha resided in the city of Sravasti, then he said: "From today onwards, you should enter the assembly in this manner.

云何入眾？若欲眾僧中有所論事，當於外斷令決了，不得便入僧中斷。

How should one enter the assembly? If there is something to discuss among the monks, it should be resolved outside before entering the assembly; it must not be decided inside the assembly.

若事難了，應語其和上、阿闍梨。

If a matter is difficult to resolve, one should inform their Upadhyaya or Acharya.

若是事不須僧斷者，應語令止。

If the matter does not require the assembly's decision, one should report it to stop.

若事必須徹僧，舉事人復是可信，應為說和合如法如律事。

If the matter must be brought to the assembly, and the person raising it is credible, it should be discussed according to the Dharma and Vinaya.

和上、阿闍梨聽已，當往僧上座前言：『我欲有所說，聽不？』

After the Upadhyaya or Acharya understands, they should go to the senior monk and say: 'I wish to speak, may I?'

上座應觀察前人語，乃至入眾時不得著革屣覆頭覆右肩，

The senior monk should consider the previous words, and when entering the assembly, do not wear shoes, cover the head, or cover the right shoulder.

當脫革屣偏袒入眾。入眾法應如是。

One should remove shoes and enter with one shoulder bared. This is how one should enter the assembly.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」

If not done this way, it transgresses the rules of conduct."



练若聚落、  
In the Aranya settlement,

The end of the fifth Bhāgya.



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘脫園中內衣已，露身求入聚落內衣，從聚落出已脫入聚落內衣，露身求園中內衣。
Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, at that time six groups of monks removed their inner robes in the garden, exposed their bodies and sought to enter the settlement for inner clothing, and after leaving the settlement, removed the inner clothing, exposing themselves to seek the garden clothing.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，乃至佛言：「應如是著衣。
Several monks for this reason went to inform the World Honored One, even until Buddha said: "This is how you should wear your clothes.

云何如是著衣？欲入聚落時不得脫園中內衣，露身求入聚落內衣；
How should you wear your clothes? When entering a settlement, you should not remove your garden inner robe and expose your body to seek settlement clothing;

不得脫入聚落內衣，露身求園中內衣。
You should not remove settlement clothing to expose your body and seek the garden robe.

欲入聚落時，當先取入聚落內衣自近，不得著聚落衣已，於下挽園中內衣出，應隨一邊著一邊脫。
When you wish to enter a settlement, you must first take your settlement inner robe close to you, do not wear the settlement robe already, then roll up the garden inner robe underneath, you should follow one side putting on while the other side removing.

出聚落時，脫入聚落內衣、著園中內衣亦爾。
Upon exiting a settlement, removing the settlement inner robe and putting on the garden inner robe should be done likewise.

著內衣法應如是。
The method of wearing inner clothing should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」
If it's not done like this, it violates the principles of conduct."



佛住舍衛城，
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti,

爾時六群比丘欲入聚落，
At that time, six groups of monks wanted to enter the village,

脫園中衣著一內衣求入聚落衣；
They removed their garden robes and wore an inner robe to request village robes;

出聚落還，
Returning from the village,

脫入聚落衣著一內衣求園中衣。
They removed the village robes and wore an inner robe to reclaim their garden robes.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，
The monks, with this reason, went to inform the Blessed One,

乃至佛言：「從今日後應如是著衣。
Finally, the Buddha said, "From today onward, you should wear the robe like this.

不得脫園中衣著一內衣求入聚落衣，
You are not allowed to remove the garden robe to wear an inner robe and request village robes,

應先取入聚落衣自近，
You should first fetch the village robe close to you,

脫園中衣襞褻舉著常處，
Remove the garden robe, fold it neatly, and place it in a usual spot,

然後著入聚落衣。
Then wear the village robe.

從聚落出已，
After exiting the village,

應取園中衣自近已，
You should take the garden robe close to you,

抖擻入聚落衣著常處。
Shaking out the village robe, put it in the usual spot.

著園中衣著衣法應如是。
The method of wearing robes should be like this.

若不如是，
If not done in this way,

越威儀法也。」
It violates the rules of conduct."



佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti,

爾時優波難陀入聚落中，

at that time Upananda entered the village,

曳衣行泥土污色，

dragging his robe, soiling it with mud,

值鉤處挽裂，

it got caught on a hook and tore,

值刺處便穿。

and pierced by thorns.

狹迮巷中搪揬而過。

He bumped and squeezed through narrow alleys.

弟子嫌言：

The disciples complained, saying:

「我等勤苦浣染縫治而不愛護。」

"We work hard to wash, dye, and mend the robes, but they are not taken care of."

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，

The monks took this incident to the Blessed One,

乃至佛言：

who said:

「從今日後入聚落時應如是著衣。

"From today, when entering the village, the robe should be worn like this.

云何如是？

How should it be?

乃至不得聚落中曳衣使穿破。

Do not drag the robe through the village to cause tearing.

若春時離聚落遠者，

If in the springtime when far from the village,

當襞褻著肩上持去。

fold the robe over the shoulder and carry it.

近聚落已，

When near the village,

若有池水、汪水，

and there is a pond or water source,

洗手脚已著衣安紐而入。

wash hands and feet, fasten the robe with a button and enter.

若無水者，

If there is no water,

樹葉、若草拭脚塵土，

wipe off the dust from the feet with leaves or grass,

然後著入。

and then put on the robe and enter.

若冬時應著衣去，

In winter, wear the robe when going out,

若逢奔馳象馬車乘，

if encountering a rushing elephant, horse, or chariot,

當在上風，

勿令塵土泥塗坌污。

to prevent being soiled by dust or mud.

若鉤刺棘不得挽裂而去，

Do not allow the robe to catch on hooks or thorns and tear,

道巷迮者不得揩揬而過。

do not brush against narrow paths or alleys.

若門狹小當側身而過，

If the door is narrow, pass through sideways,

若下者當曲身而過。

if low, bend the body to pass through.

入聚落著衣法當如是。

This is how one should dress when entering the village.

若不如是，

If not done this way,

越威儀法。」

it violates the rules of decorum."



佛住舍衛城，爾時難陀、優波難陀不敷坐具而坐，以衣盛爛果膩餅而污衣。
When the Buddha was staying at Savatthi, there were times when Nanda and Upananda sat without proper seating and soiled their robes with rotten fruit and oily cakes.

弟子嫌言：「我勤苦浣染治而不愛護。」
The disciples complained, "We put effort into washing and caring for the robes, yet they are not protected."

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，
The monks brought this matter to the attention of the Blessed One,

乃至佛言：「從今日入白衣家內衣應如是。
Up to the point where the Buddha said, "From today onwards, when entering a layperson's home, your robes should be like this.

云何如是？若床有塵土不淨，不敷物不得坐。
How should they be? If the bed is dusty or unclean, you should not sit without laying something down.

若見親舊應語言令敷，
If you see acquaintances, you should ask them to lay something down for you.

若彼言：『此沙門憍恣難事。』者，
If they remark, 'These ascetics are demanding,'

當自拂拭敷坐具洗手而坐。
then you should clean the seat yourself, lay down something, wash your hands, and sit.

不得以衣承取一切餅果、濕華、碎末、拭口。
Do not use your robe to hold cakes, fruits, fresh flowers, powder, or to wipe your mouth.

白衣家內坐護衣應如是。
In a layperson's home, you should protect your robes in this manner.

若不如是，越威儀法也。」
If you do not do this, you violate the rules of proper conduct."



佛住舍衛城，爾時優波難陀語難陀共行弟子言：「我欲共汝入聚落乞食，我於彼若作非威儀者，莫向人說，我是汝叔父。」
The Buddha was staying in the city of Sravasti, and at that time, Upananda said to his fellow disciple Nanda, "I want to go with you into the village to beg for food. If I behave improperly there, do not tell anyone that I am your uncle."

答言：「設使我父及祖父作非威儀者我亦當道。」如上廣說。
He replied, "Even if my father or grandfather acted improperly, I would still point it out." It is explained at length above.

乃至答言：「實爾世尊！」
He even answered, "Indeed, World-Honored One!"

佛言：「從今日後，前沙門應如是、後沙門應如是。
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, the leading monk should act in this way, and the following monk should act in this way.

云何前後沙門應如是？
How should the leading and following monks act in this way?

前沙門若能得食者當共食，若不能得者當早遣令還索食。
If the leading monk can obtain food, they should share it; if they cannot, they should send someone back early to seek food.

後行沙門不得去前者太遠使不相見，不得大逼相躡脚跟，當相去一舒手以外。
The following monk should not go too far ahead so that they cannot see the leading monk, nor should they closely press or step on their heels but should maintain a distance further than an outstretched hand.

前有惡象馬牛，當言：『和上、阿闍梨！前有惡物，當避一處。』
If there are dangerous elephants, horses, or cattle ahead, they should say, 'Teacher, Acharaya! There is a danger ahead, take shelter in a place.'

若前行沙門羸老者，當在前與遮。
If the leading monk is weak or elderly, they should be at the front providing cover.

若前有禮者，當語：『某甲禮。』
If there are greetings ahead, they should say, 'So-and-so greetings.'

若有人請食，後沙門應憶，還住處已應語：『向某甲家請。』
If someone invites them to eat, the following monk should remember, and upon returning to the dwelling place, say, 'They invited us earlier to a certain house.'

若前沙門不能呪願，語令能呪願者呪願。
If the leading monk cannot recite blessings, they should instruct someone who can recite to perform the blessings.

不得言：『汝在前坐、前取水、前食，而使我呪願？』應當呪願。
They should not say, 'You sit at the front, take water first, eat first, and make me recite the blessings?' They should perform the blessings.

前沙門後沙門應如是。若不如是，越威儀法。
The leading and following monks should act in this way. If not, they violate the rules of conduct.



住在，當時有比丘請人幫忙拿食物，結果放下鉢後便離開了。  
In the city of Shravasti, there was a dwelling of the Buddha. At that time, a monk asked someone to bring him food but left after handing over the bowl.

那位拿食物的比丘拿著食物來，四處尋找卻不知所踪，便將鉢留在禪堂上然後離開。  
The monk who collected the food returned with it, looked around but couldn't find anyone, so he left the bowl on the meditation hall and departed.

第二天有比丘問：「能還我鉢嗎？」  
The next day, a monk asked, "Can you return my bowl?"

回答說：「我把鉢放在禪堂上了。」  
The answer was, "I left the bowl on the meditation hall."

又說：「你為何將我的鉢放在空的禪堂中？」  
He replied, "Why did you put my bowl in an empty meditation hall?"

那人說：「你為何讓我代你取食物後便棄我而去？」  
He said, "Why did you ask me to get your food and then leave me?"

兩個人爭論不休，便前往佛所在的地方，把事情告訴世尊。  
The two argued endlessly and went to where the Buddha was to report the matter to him.

佛說：「從今天起，請人拿食物的應該這樣做，而拿食物的也應該這樣做。  
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, those who ask others to get food should do so in this way, and those who deliver food should also follow these rules.

如何請人拿食物、給人拿食物應該這樣做呢？  
How should one ask others to get or give food?

不可請人拿食物后便放下不理，也不可把食物放在空的禪堂內便離去。  
Do not ask someone to get food and then abandon it, nor leave the food in an empty meditation hall and leave.

給他拿食物的人，應該先說：「長老！我現在去取食物，請暫時休息，準備好等我。」  
To the person who provides the food, it should be said first, "Elder! I am going to get food now, please stand by and be prepared for my return."

取食物的人應該知道時間，如果快到時刻，應該優先帶來。  
The person who goes for food should be aware of the time, and if it is urgent, they should prioritize bringing it back.

如果時間還早，則應按順序坐下取用。  
If there is enough time, they should sit in order and take their turns.

取食物時不應混雜，應各自分開用完後帶回。  
When taking food, it should not be mixed, and after consuming separately, it should be brought back.

如果時間急迫，不得在那裡吃，應該帶兩份食物回去。  
If time is pressing, one should not eat there but bring back two portions.

回來的時候應該估計好時間，應該來得及時。  
When returning, they should anticipate the time appropriately and come back on time.

如果不及時，便在那裡進食，避免兩人都錯過用餐。  
If timing is missed, then eat there to prevent both from missing the meal.

請食物的人不應該說：「我已經請到了。」然後就不理了。  
The one who solicits food should not say, "I have already asked," and then ignore it.

應該先刷牙、準備水、鋪好床座、洗手然後等待。  
They should first brush their teeth, prepare water, lay down the bedding, wash hands, and then wait.

應該多次觀察太陽，如果時間快到，應該拿上水罐去接應。  
They should frequently check the sun, and if time is running out, they should take a water vessel and go for a meeting.

如果途中有遇到人一起吃，或者故意提早的人，應等待然後食用。  
If they meet someone on the way to eat together, or if someone intentionally comes early, they should wait and eat afterward.

如果有長者在場，應該把食物給長者，而不得給其他人；  
If there is an elder present, food should be given to the elder, not to others.

如果不需要的話，可以給其他人。  
If it is not necessary, it can be distributed to others.

迎接食物的規範應該如此，如果不這樣做，便違反禮儀法。」  
The protocol for receiving food should thus be maintained, and failure to do so is a breach of proper conduct.   



，爾時六群比丘入城乞食，低頭直進入白衣家，搪揬前人，為世人所嫌言：「沙門釋子猶如羯羊，直前觸人。」
The Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī, and at that time, six groups of monks entered the city for alms, bowing their heads and walking straight into the householder's home, pushing past people, which led to criticism from the townsfolk: "The monks of the Shakya are like rams, charging straight at people."

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks reported this incident to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後乞食法應如是。
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, the practice of seeking alms should be like this.

云何如是？不得如羯羊直頭徑前，不得復大遠離在於不見處，當在現處住。
How should it be? You must not walk straight ahead like a ram, nor should you wander far into places that are out of sight; you should stay where you are visible.

不得言：『與我食當得大福。』
You should not say, 'Give me food and you will gain great merit.'

應默然而立，不得左顧右視使人生疑，謂是賊、細作。
You should stand silently and not look around, causing people to suspect you as a thief or a spy.

當攝六情觀於無常，亦不得大久住。
Focus your six senses on the contemplation of impermanence, and do not stay for a long time.

若其家婦女有舂擣作事，未視之頃可小停住。
If the women of the house are pounding or working, you may pause briefly before being noticed.

若彼見已復舂作者當去。
If they see you and resume their work, you should leave.

若見婦人紡線，纏已復紡者，此無與心應去。
If you see a woman spinning thread and she resumes after looking at you, you should leave as this shows a lack of interest.

若女人見已，入舍空出者應去。
If a woman sees you and leaves to fetch something but comes back empty-handed, you should leave.

若是富家處處多有寶物者，不得便去；呼語，見已應去。
If it is a wealthy household with valuables everywhere, you should not linger; if called or spoken to, you should leave as soon as you are seen.

乞食法應如是。若不如是，越威儀法。」
The practice of seeking alms should be like this. If not done this way, it violates the rules of conduct."



佛住舍衛城，爾時優波難陀與共行弟子入聚落乞食，優波難陀持食出還，覓弟子不見，嫌言：「我持食來，捨我而去。」
The Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti. At that time, Upananda went into the village with his fellow disciples to beg for food. Upananda returned with food, but could not find his disciples. He complained, saying, "I brought food, and they left me."

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
Due to this incident, the monks approached the World-Honored One.

佛言：「從今日後乞食時，後沙門應如是。
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, when begging for food, monks should do as follows.

云何如是？
How should it be done?

前沙門乞食時，不得大離遠、不得大近邊看，令主人生念言：『不能乞食，望得他殘耳？』
When the first monk is begging, do not stay too far or too close to watch, so as not to cause the host to think, 'Are they unable to beg and waiting for leftovers?'

當在現處住。
You should stay in the current place.

若請食者應食，若不請者當乞食。
If invited to eat, then eat; if not invited, continue to beg.

若井、若池水邊食已，洗鉢而去無罪。
After eating by the well or pond, washing the bowl and leaving is not a wrongdoing.

食時相待應如是。
When eating, this mutual waiting should be observed.

若不如是，越威儀法也。
If not done this way, it violates the formal conduct."

第六跋渠竟。
The sixth trail is finally over.




佛住舍衛城，爾時諸比丘闇中入禪坊倒地。
The Buddha lived in the city of Śrāvastī; at that time, the monks stumbled and fell in the meditation hall in the dark.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks told the Blessed One about this incident.

佛言：「從今日聽然燈。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you are allowed to light lamps."

時六群比丘當直然燈，以口吹滅、以手扇滅、以衣扇滅，復放下風，擾亂諸坐禪比丘。
At that time, the six groups of monks who were on duty extinguished the lamps by blowing them out, fanning them with their hands and robes, and letting down winds, disturbing the meditating monks.

比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今已後然燈法應如是。云何如是？
The Buddha said, "From now on, the rules for lighting lamps should be as follows. How should it be?

應從最下次第當直，當直人應預辦木鑽、牛屎於食屋中宿火，不得頓然燈，當置火一邊漸次然之。
It should start from the lowest in order of duty. The person on duty should prepare a wooden drill and cow dung for the kitchen's hearth and should not suddenly light the lamp but ignite it gradually from one side.

然燈時當先然照舍利及形像前燈，禮拜已當出滅之。
When lighting lamps, first illuminate the relics and images, then after paying respects, extinguish them.

次然廁屋中。
Next, light the lamps in the restroom.

若坐禪時至者，應然禪坊中，應唱言：『諸大德呪願燈隨喜。』
When it is time for meditation, lamps should be lit in the meditation hall, and it should be announced: 'Great virtues, please bless and rejoice in the light.'

次然道經行處，次然閣道頭。
Next, light the path, then the pavilion path's end.

若多油者，廁屋中當竟夜然；若油少者，人行斷當滅。
If there is plenty of oil, the restroom lamps should be kept on all night; if oil is scarce, extinguish them when people stop moving.

滅已次滅道經行處、次滅閣道頭、次滅禪坊中燈。
Extinguish in the order of the path, then the pavilion path's end, and then the meditation hall lamps.

滅禪坊中燈時不得卒滅，當言：『諸大德敷褥，欲滅燈。』
When extinguishing the meditation hall lamps, do not extinguish suddenly; say: 'Great virtues, arrange your mats, the lamps will be extinguished.'

便以手遮唱言：『燈欲滅！燈欲滅！』
Cover with your hand and say: 'The lamp is going out! The lamp is going out!'

不聽用口吹滅、手扇滅及衣扇滅，當𭣿折頭燋去。
Do not blow out with the mouth, fan with the hand or robe, but twist the wick to snuff it.

至後夜時當復起，先然廁屋、次然道經行處、次然閣道頭、次然禪坊中。

At dawn, extinguish in order: start with the pavilion path's end, then the path, the restroom, and finally the meditation hall lamps.

然燈法應如是。若不如是，越威儀法也。」
The rules for lighting lamps should be like this. If not, it violates the rules of conduct."



，爾時諸比丘禪坊中坐禪，低仰而睡。

The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī; at that time, the monks were meditating in the meditation hall, nodding and dozing off. 

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。

The monks, on account of this, went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今已後應行禪杖。」

The Buddha said: "From now on, you should practice with a meditation stick."

六群比丘行禪杖時，擣比丘脇肋，彼即驚喚：「殺我！長老。」

When the six groups of monks practiced with the meditation stick, they jabbed the monks' ribs, causing them to cry out in alarm: "You're killing me, elder!"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，乃至佛言：「從今日後應如是行禪杖。」

Because of this incident, the monks went to report to the Blessed One, until the Buddha said: "From this day forward, the meditation stick should be used as follows."

作禪杖法應用竹、若𥯤，長八肘，物裹兩頭，下坐應行。

The meditation stick should be made of bamboo, or rattan, eight cubits long, with both ends wrapped, and should be used while sitting.

行時不得覆頭、覆右肩、著革屣，當偏袒右肩。

When practicing, do not cover the head, cover the right shoulder, or wear leather shoes; the right shoulder should be exposed. 

若有睡者，不得卒急喚起、不得擣脇，當併邊以杖拄前三搖。

If someone is sleeping, do not suddenly and urgently wake them or jab their ribs; instead, place the stick at their side and shake it three times in front. 

復不覺者，若在左邊當拄右膝，若在右邊當拄左膝。

If they are still not aware, if on the left side, support the right knee; if on the right side, support the left knee. 

覺已當起，取杖而行，亦不得覆頭、覆右肩，當偏袒而行。

Once awake, they should get up, take the stick and proceed, without covering the head or right shoulder, and walk with the right shoulder exposed. 

若睡者眾多，不得如牛一時併起，應兩人三人起。

If many are asleep, they should not wake up all at once like cattle, but should wake in groups of two or three. 

年少應行杖，若和上、阿闍梨睡，亦應令起，恭敬法故。

The younger ones should use the stick, and if the preceptor or teacher is asleep, they should also be made to rise, out of respect for the practice.

應起取杖，弟子不得與杖，當自行。

One should rise and take the stick themselves; the disciple should not hand it to them, but they should do it themselves.

行杖人不得隨瞋愛而求其過，當攝六情一心思惟。

While using the stick, one should not seek others' faults out of anger or affection, but should focus and contemplate with a unified mind. 

若有睡眠者應與，彼取杖人不得嫌恨，當作是念：『彼今與我除陰蓋，益我不少。』

If someone is asleep, they should admonish; the one who receives the stick should not be resentful, but should think: 'They are now helping remove my hindrances, benefiting me greatly.'

念已應起行，若有睡者應與。

Having thought this, one should rise and proceed; if someone is asleep, they should be admonished.

行禪杖法應如是。

The practice of using the meditation stick should be as such. 

若不如是，越威儀法也。」

If not done this way, one violates the rules of deportment."


，爾時比丘行禪杖，天寒手戰。

The Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti. At that time, the monks were practicing walking meditation, and their hands were shivering in the cold.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，佛言：「從今日後應作丸。」

The monks, concerned about this, went to report to the Blessed One. The Buddha said, "From today onwards, you should make balls."

六群比丘行丸時，擲胸、擲面，比丘驚言：「殺我！」

The group of six monks, while playing with the balls, threw them at each other's chests and faces. The monks were startled and said, "They are killing me!"

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。

The monks, concerned about this, went to report it to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後作丸法、擲丸法應如是。

The Buddha said, "From today onward, the method for making and throwing balls should be as follows.

云何如是？作丸法應用若線、若毛、若㲲作，不得令太堅、不得太軟。

What does it mean to be as such? The method for making balls should use thread, wool, or cotton. It should not be too hard or too soft.

行法當先與中央人，若有睡者不得趣擲頭面，當擲前。

The practice of throwing should start with the person in the center. If someone is asleep, the ball should not be thrown at their head or face but rather towards the front.

前人恭敬法故應起取，取已還坐。

The person in front should rise respectfully to receive the ball, and once received, should sit down again.

若和上、阿闍梨睡者，不得置，亦應與丸，彼恭敬法故應起，弟子應代行丸。

If the preceptor or teacher is asleep, they should not be passed over; the ball should still be given to them. They should rise respectfully, and a disciple should play with the ball on their behalf.

彼應還坐，不得俠恨求過。

They should then sit down again without harboring resentment or seeking faults.

得丸者當作是念：『彼今與我除陰覆，饒益不少。』

The one receiving the ball should think, 'This person now helps me remove my burdens, which benefits me greatly.'

行丸法應如是。若不如是，越威儀法。」

The method of playing with the ball should be like this. If it is not, the etiquette of the practice is transgressed.



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘禪坊戶前脫革屣，以底相拍如提乾魚而入，亂坐禪比丘。
Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī, at that time six groups of monks removed their leather shoes at the meditation hall entrance, clapping the soles together like drying fish as they entered, disrupting the meditating monks.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，乃至佛言：「從今已後禪坊中脫革屣應如是。
The monks, due to this reason, went to report to the World-Honored One, and the Buddha said, "From now on, removing leather shoes in the meditation hall should be like this.

How should it be? Do not clap leather shoes in front of the meditation hall door.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊。
The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今已後禪坊中尼師檀應如是。
The Buddha said, "Henceforth, in the meditation hall, the robes should be as follows.

云何如是？不得禪坊中抖擻尼師檀，當中襞褻置左肩上而去，到已中屈疊敷而坐。
How should they be? They must not be shaken in the meditation hall; they should be draped over the left shoulder when leaving, and when reaching the destination, they should be folded properly and then used to sit.

來時亦當襞褻著肩上而還。
Upon returning, they should also be folded and worn over the shoulder.

若欲置常處者當中掩之，還時當徐舒而坐。
If you wish to place them in a regular spot, they should be spread in the middle; when returning, they should be gradually unfolded and sat upon.

禪坊中尼師檀應如是。
Robes in the meditation hall should be like this.

若不如是，越威儀法。
If not, it violates the rules of proper conduct."



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘禪坊中故大謦欬作聲，亂諸比丘。
The Buddha resided in the city of Sravasti, and at that time six groups of monks were making loud coughing sounds in the meditation hall, disturbing the other monks.

「從今已後禪坊中謦欬應如是。
"From now on, coughing in the meditation hall should be done as follows.

云何如是？
How should it be done?

若欲謦欬時不得放恣故大作聲，當掩口徐徐作聲。
If you want to cough, do not make a loud noise arbitrarily; instead, cover your mouth and cough softly.

If the cough is uncontrollable, you should stand up, leave the hall, finish coughing, and then return.

Completely repenting for having transgressed the Vinaya.

威儀竟。
