This sutra is considered by many to be Shakyamuni Buddha's foremost teaching on wisdom. Of all the Agama (Early Buddhist Texts) this is the only one Xuanzang chose to translate into Chinese.

Reading, contemplating and practicing sutras like this can lead to various forms of realization.

This mind intending to gain realizations for one's own benefit may ascend to the highest states of mind, serving as the causal condition of tumbling down to the lowest lows. Realizing everything is empty, becoming the god-king of empty, this mind negates all beings might even negate itself. Goes back to ignorance, mind directed at nothing, forgetting nothing depends on something.

This mind realizing for the benefit of others realizes that all beings are empty, returns to the vow to benefit beings regardless, turns the mind towards the unseparated quality of all beings and all things.

The first mind takes as its condition a separate self that realizes. Realizing that self to be empty, what motivation is left for deeper realization?

The second mind does not depend upon subject ("I") or object ("other") being separate, realizes freely without a conditional self basis. Continues upon the condition of this vow to benefit beings, realizes the inconceivable, beyond the realm of separate self and other.
