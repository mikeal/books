訶僧祇律卷第三十九東晉天竺三藏佛陀跋陀羅共法顯譯

Mahasanghika Vinaya Scroll 39 translated by the Tripitaka Master Buddhabhadra and Faxian in Eastern Jin Dynasty




第三章的核心思想是什么？

What is the central idea of Chapter Three?

讨论围绕幸福的真正含义展开。

The discussion revolves around the true meaning of happiness.

作者提到，我们常常误解了幸福。

The author mentions that we often misunderstand happiness.

许多人认为幸福与物质财富有关。

Many people believe that happiness is related to material wealth.

然而，作者提出幸福来自内心的满足感。

However, the author suggests that happiness comes from inner satisfaction.

这包括对自我和他人的理解和接纳。

This includes understanding and accepting oneself and others.

追求幸福需要内心和平。

The pursuit of happiness requires inner peace.

作者观察到，冥想和正念是找到幸福的工具。

The author observes that meditation and mindfulness are tools for finding happiness.

这些实践帮助我们与自身和外界的联系更加紧密。

These practices help us connect more deeply with ourselves and the world.

通过这些练习，人们可以培养同情和耐心。

Through these exercises, one can cultivate compassion and patience.

因此，幸福不是外部获得的，而是一种内在的状态。

Thus, happiness is not externally acquired but is an inner state.




佛住舍衛城，
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī,

爾時釋種女、拘梨女、摩羅女、梨車女，先已嫁出家，曾任苦事故而有黠慧。
at that time, a group of noble women including Shakya women, Koliya women, Mallā women, and Licchavī women, who had married and then renounced to live the monastic life, were known for their diligence and wisdom.

大愛道瞿曇彌問佛：「世尊！已嫁女減二十雨得與受具足不？」
Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī asked the Buddha, "World-Honored One! Can a woman who has married take full ordination before spending twenty full rains in the monastic community?"

佛言：「得。」
The Buddha said, "Yes, they can."

爾時比丘尼與曾嫁八歲、九歲女受具足，太小軟弱不堪苦事。
At that time, certain nuns were ordaining girls as young as eight or nine who had previously been married, even though they were too young and weak to endure the hardship of monastic life.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The nuns reported this to Mahāprajāpatī, who went to the Buddha with the matter, suggesting that any prior teachings should be reinforced.

「若比丘尼適他婦，減十二雨，與受具足者，波夜提。」
"If a nun ordains a married woman who is under twelve rains in the monastic community, it results in a pācittiya offense."



減十二雨者，如減二十雨中廣說。
Reduce twelve rain, as explained extensively in the reduction of twenty rain.




適他婦者，壞梵行。
A man who goes to another's wife destroys a pure conduct.




與受具足者，波夜提。
The rules are given to the fully ordained, as mentioned above.

波夜提者，如上說。
The rules, as stated above.



若適他婦欲於如來法律中受具足者，
If a foreign woman wishes to receive full ordination in the Tathagata's law,

應先問乃至看手足骨節。
she should first be asked or examined regarding her hands and feet joints.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World Honored One said.




佛住舍衛城，爾時世尊制戒，不聽減十二雨適他婦受具足。
Buddha was staying in Shravasti, at that time the World-Honored One established precepts, forbidding giving full ordination to women who spent less than twelve rains.

爾時比丘尼適他家，婦滿十二雨與受具足。
At that time, a nun went to another family, and a woman who had spent twelve rains was given full ordination.

諸比丘尼嫌言：「汝滿十二雨適他婦，滿與不滿誰知者？」
The nuns criticized saying: "You have spent twelve rains as another's woman, who knows if it's complete or not?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道往白世尊，乃至佛言：「從今已後滿十二雨適他婦，應與二年學戒。」
The nuns spoke to Mahaprajapati, who went to report to the World-Honored One, and the Buddha said: "From now on, a woman who has spent twelve rains as another's should undergo two years of training precepts."

佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。
Buddha told Mahaprajapati: "Gather all the nuns residing in Shravasti, so that even those who have heard already may hear again."

若比丘尼適他婦滿十二雨，不與學戒，受具足者，波夜提。」
If a nun who has been another's woman for twelve rains is granted full ordination without going through training precepts, it is a transgression."

如上童女不學戒中說。
This is explained as in the case of a virgin not undergoing training precepts.



面骂不满度、  
Openly scolded for dissatisfaction,

十法不具足、  
The ten practices are not complete,




不羯磨畜眾、  
Without performing the formal act, gather the assembly,  

犯戒減二十、  
Violation of precepts reduces by twenty,  




不學不滿學，  
Unlearned, unsatisfied with learning,

滿學不羯磨、  
Satisfied with full learning, not engaging in discussion,



不學無術的人不值得尊重。  
People who do not learn any skills are not worthy of respect.  

每一個承諾都有結局。  
Every promise has an ending.  



，爾時迦梨比丘尼度王臣須提那婦出家與受學戒，本在家有娠，轉轉腹大。
The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī. At that time, a nun named Kāli received her monastic training precepts after leaving the household life. Originally pregnant while at home, her belly grew larger and larger.

諸比丘尼嫌言：「已受學戒而有娠體，應驅出。」答言：「我出家已來不知是法。」
The nuns murmured, saying: "Having accepted the learning precepts and now being pregnant, she should be expelled." She replied, "Since I left the household life, I haven't understood this matter."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道以是因緣往白世尊。
The nuns spoke to Mahāprajāpatī, and she, for this reason, approached the Blessed One to report it.

佛言：「此出家已來不知是法，此在家時事。若有如是比者，未應與受具足。
The Buddha said, "She is unaware of this matter since leaving the household life; this is an affair from her time at home. If someone is like this, she should not yet receive full ordination.

待㝃身已，若生女者，出草蓐已與受具足；若生男者，待兒能離乳然後與受具足。
Wait until she gives birth. If she gives birth to a girl, after she's done with postpartum confinement, she can receive full ordination. If it's a boy, wait until the child is weaned before giving full ordination.

若親里姊妹言：『取是小兒來，我自養活。』如是者應與受具足。」
If a relative or sister says, 'Bring the child to me, I will raise it,' in such cases, full ordination can be given."

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, "Gather all the nuns who reside in Śrāvastī, so even those who have already heard it may hear it again.

若比丘尼，已適他婦受學戒，不滿學與受具足者，波夜提。」
If a nun, already married to another woman, receives the training precepts but does not complete her training before receiving full ordination, it's a Pācittiya offense."

如上童女學戒不滿中廣說。
As described above, the rules for training precepts for maidens are explained in detail.


，爾時世尊制戒，不聽滿十二雨適他婦、二年學戒不滿與受具足。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, at that time, the World-Honored One established the precepts, not allowing those who have lived twelve years with a spouse or those who have studied for two years without full ordination to receive full ordination.

爾時比丘尼與適他婦二年學戒滿與受具足，諸比丘尼嫌言：「汝學戒滿與不滿，誰能知者？」
At that time, bhikshunis questioned those women who were given full ordination after two years of study with a spouse, saying, "How can anyone know whether you have completed your studies for ordination or not?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道以是事往白世尊，乃至佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：
The bhikshunis reported to Mahāprajāpatī, who, in turn, reported the matter to the World-Honored One, and then the Buddha said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī:

「依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。
"All bhikshunis residing in Śrāvastī should be gathered together so that even those who have already heard may hear again.

若比丘尼，已適他婦學戒滿，不羯磨，與受具足者，波夜提。」
If a bhikshuni, having already been with a spouse, completes her studies without a formal procedure, and is given full ordination, it results in a transgression."

如上童女不羯磨中廣說。
As elaborated in the procedure for formal procedures for maidens mentioned above.



，爾時比丘尼多畜弟子，不教誡，如天牛、天羊，淨不具足、威儀不具足、不知承事和上阿闍梨、不知承事長老比丘尼、不知入聚落法阿練若法、不知著衣持鉢法。
The Buddha resided in Śrāvastī. At that time, the bhikkhunis had many disciples but did not instruct them properly, like heavenly oxen and sheep, lacking purity, lacking conduct and demeanor, and did not know how to serve their preceptors, senior teachers, elders, and bhikkhunis; they did not know the proper ways to enter villages or wear their robes and hold their bowls.

比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。
A bhikkhuni spoke to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, who then went to report this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已，佛問：「汝實爾不？」
The Buddha said, "Call that bhikkhuni here." After she arrived, the Buddha asked, "Is this true for you?"

答言：「實爾。」世尊！佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何度人而不教誡？
She replied, "It is true, Blessed One!" The Buddha said, "This is a wrong practice. How can you save people without instructing them?

從今已後應二年教誡。」
From now on, you should instruct them for two years."

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：「依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, "Gather all the bhikkhunis residing in Śrāvastī so that those who have heard this may hear it again.

若比丘尼與弟子受具足已，應二年教誡，若不教者，波夜提。」
If a bhikkhuni receives a disciple, she should instruct them for two years; if she fails to do so, it is a Pācittiya offense."



比丘尼者，如上說。
A bhikkhuni is as described above.




弟子者，共住弟子。
A disciple is a disciple who lives with others.




二年者，二雨時。
Every other year, twice in the rainy season.




教誡者，若阿毘曇、若毘尼。
A preceptor is one who understands Abhidhamma and Vinaya.

阿毘曇者，九部修多羅。
Abhidhamma means the nine divisions of the Suttas.

毘尼者，波羅提木叉廣略。
Vinaya refers to the full and concise rules of the Prātimokṣa.

威儀應教，非威儀應遮。
Proper behavior should be taught; improper behavior should be restrained.

若不教誡者，波夜提。
If one does not instruct, it leads to transcending boundaries.



若弟子不可教、不欲學者，應驅出。  
If a disciple cannot be taught or is unwilling to learn, they should be expelled.

若比丘共住弟子不教勅，越毘尼罪。  
If a monk lives with a disciple and does not instruct them, it is a violation of the Vinaya.

是故世尊說。  
Therefore, the World-Honored One said.




，

The Buddha was living in Śrāvastī,

爾時比丘尼度弟子，

At that time, a bhikshuni was mentoring a disciple,

弟子受具足已棄餘處去。

The disciple, upon full ordination, left for another place.

時和上尼嫌言：「世尊制戒應教誡弟子，

Then the elder nun complained, "The World-Honored One has prescribed rules and I should instruct disciples,

弟子捨我去，我當教誡誰？」

but if the disciple leaves me, whom should I instruct?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，

Other bhikshunis spoke to Mahāprajāpatī,

大愛道即以是事具白世尊。

Mahāprajāpatī then reported this matter to the World-Honored One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」

The Buddha said, "Call that bhikshuni here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」

Upon her arrival, he asked, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，

The Buddha said, "This is a wrong action,

汝云何受具足已而餘處去？

How can you, having received full ordination, go elsewhere?

應二年事和上尼。」

You should serve the elder nun for two years."

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：

The Buddha said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī,

「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，

"Gather all the bhikshunis residing in Śrāvastī,

乃至已聞者當重聞。

so that even those who have heard before can hear again.

若比丘尼受具足已，

If a bhikshuni receives full ordination,

應二年供給、隨逐和上尼，

she should serve and follow the elder nun for two years.

若不供給、隨逐，波夜提。」

If she does not serve or follow, it is an offense." 




受具足者，

Those who fully receive (the precepts),

共住弟子。

live together as disciples.




二年者，二雨時。
In those two years, there were two rainy seasons.




供給者，供給和上尼。
To the one who provides, supply and to the senior nun.

應隨逐者，不遠離。
One who should follow, do not stay far.

不供給隨逐者，波夜提。
Not supplying those who follow, is an offense (pācittiya).



若和上尼不善持戒、不欲學，弟子作是念：「我和上尼但非威儀處行，我若隨逐或傷我梵行。」
If a superior nun does not observe the precepts well and shows no desire to learn, a disciple may think, "My superior nun only acts informally, if I follow her, it may harm my pure conduct."

欲全梵行故，捨去無罪。
In order to maintain pure conduct, leaving is without sin.

若比丘不供給和上隨侍，越毘尼罪。
If a monk does not attend and serve the superior, it is a violation of the Vinaya.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One has spoken.



，爾時比丘尼年年度弟子受具足，心生疑惑，為得為不得？
The Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, and at that time, a bhikkhuni had her disciple receive full ordination every year, causing doubts in her heart as to whether this could be done or not.

即問大愛道，大愛道往白世尊。
She questioned Mahāprajāpatī, who then went to inform the Blessed One.

佛言：「喚是比丘尼來。」
The Buddha said, "Call that bhikkhuni here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」
After she came, He asked, "Is it true for you?"

答言：「實爾。」
She answered, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後不聽年年度人受具足，當作間。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, one is not allowed to ordain disciples yearly; there should be an interval."

佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。若比丘尼年年畜弟子，波夜提。」
The Buddha told Mahāprajāpatī, "Gather all the bhikkhunis residing in Śrāvastī so that even those who have already heard it will hear it again. If a bhikkhuni keeps having disciples annually, it is an offense of expiation."




年年者，雨雨時。
Year after year, the rains come on time.




畜弟子者，受具足。  
One who keeps disciples receives fullness.




波夜提者，如上說。

The one called Bo Ye, as mentioned above.




不聽年年畜弟子，
Not allowed to have disciples every year,

應作一雨時間。
Should be done during the rainy season.

若比丘尼有福德，
If a Bhikkhuni has virtuous qualities,

一年與學戒弟子，
One year with a disciple learning the precepts,

二年與受具足，
Two years with a fully ordained disciple,

雖年年無罪。
Even if there is no fault year after year.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.




，爾時樹提比丘尼欲與弟子受具足，語偷蘭難陀比丘尼言：「阿梨耶！為我請僧與弟子受具足後，比丘尼僧與受具足。」

The Buddha was residing in Rajagaha. At that time, the nun Sudatta wanted to ordain her disciples, so she said to the nun Thullananda, "Noble one, please invite the monastics for the ordination of my disciples after which the ordination ceremony will take place."

偷蘭難陀比丘尼請得六群比丘。

The nun Thullananda invited the group of six monks.

樹提問言：「為我請得僧未？」

Sudatta asked, "Have you invited the monastics for me?"

答言：「已得。」

The reply was, "Yes, I have."

「得誰？」

"Who have you invited?"

答言：「得六群比丘。」

The reply was, "The group of six monks."

語言：「我不用，至明日更請善比丘受具足。」

She said, "I do not want them; please invite virtuous monks again tomorrow for the ordination."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。

The nuns told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, who then reported the matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「喚是比丘尼來。」

The Buddha said, "Call that nun here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」

When she came, He asked, "Is it true what you have said?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "It is true."

佛言樹提：「此是惡事，汝云何一眾清淨已停宿受具足，而復輕眾。

The Buddha said to Sudatta: "This is a wrongful act. How could you disregard a complete assembly that was prepared for ordination, thereby disrespecting the community?"

從今日後不聽一眾清淨停宿受具足，亦不聽輕眾。」

"From this day forth, it is not permissible to reject a complete assembly gathered for ordination, nor to show disrespect to the community."

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：「依止王舍城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: "Let all the nuns residing in Rajagaha be assembled so that those who have heard this teaching may hear it again."

若比丘尼一眾清淨停宿受具足，波夜提。」

"If any nun disregards a complete assembly prepared for ordination, it is an offense of expiation."




比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhunī: as stated above.




一眾清淨者，比丘尼眾中受具足。
These virtuous ones, in the assembly of nuns, attained completeness.




停宿者，至明日比丘眾中受具足，波夜提。

The one who stops for the night, tomorrow will receive the complete ordination among the monks, Pratimoksha.




波夜提者，如上說。
Boya Tizhe, as mentioned above.




不聽一眾清淨停宿受具足，復不聽輕眾，復不得請惡比丘眾與受具足，應當先求善比丘。
Do not permit a single pure assembly to temporarily stay and receive complete precepts, nor allow them to belittle the assembly, nor invite wicked monks to receive complete precepts. One should first seek virtuous monks.

若不可得當求半，若過半許而作羯磨。
If it is not obtainable, one should seek half. If more than half is permitted, then perform the formal act.

若王賊難不得者，停宿無罪。
If hindered by kings or robbers, there is no fault in temporarily staying.

比丘亦不得輕眾。
Monks should also not belittle the assembly.

應得半，若過半而作羯磨，輕眾者得越毘尼罪。
They should obtain half; if more than half is achieved and the formal act is performed, those who belittle the assembly commit a transgression against the Vinaya.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One spoke.



，爾時迦梨比丘尼度梨車第三生女出家，與俗人外道習近住。
The Buddha resided in Vaiśālī, at that time the nun Kāli initiated the laywoman Doli-cā's third daughter into the monastic life, who was associating closely with non-Buddhists.

諸比丘尼語迦梨比丘尼：「汝知是弟子與俗人外道習近住，汝何故不別離送於異方？」
The nuns told Ānanda Kāli: "You know this disciple is associating closely with non-Buddhists, why don't you separate and send her elsewhere?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。
The nuns informed Mahāprajāpatī, who then reported the matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」
The Buddha said, "Call that nun here." Upon her arrival, He asked, "Is it true?" She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何知弟子共俗人外道習近住而不離別？從今已後不聽。」
The Buddha said, "This is a bad matter. How can you know your disciple is closely associating with non-Buddhists and not separate her? From now on, this is not allowed."

佛告大愛道：「依止毘舍離住比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told Mahāprajāpatī, "Gather all the nuns residing near Vaiśālī, even those who have already heard, they should hear again."

若比丘尼度弟子有事，不自送、不使人送，下至五六由旬，波夜提。
If a nun has initiated a disciple and there is a matter, and she does not personally send her or make others send her away, even within a range of five to six yojanas, it is an offense of expiation.


比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhuni, as mentioned above.




度人者，和上尼。
Those who guide others, harmonize.




弟子者，共行弟子。
Disciples, those who practice together.




有事者，弟子欲罷道

When there is something important, a disciple may want to stop.

若父母親里欲罷道

If parents or close relatives want to stop.

若婿若叔欲罷道。

If sons-in-law or uncles want to stop.



若不自送、不使人送。
If neither you deliver it personally nor have someone else deliver it.




下至五、六由旬者，極齊六。
Those who are within five or six yojanas are extremely unified.

若弟子習近住者，應送遊行，
If a disciple is accustomed to living nearby, they should be sent on a journey,

若身老病不能去者應囑人，
If one is old or ill and unable to go, they should instruct someone else,

當教誡：「汝可遊方，多有功德，禮諸塔寺、見好徒眾、多所見聞，
They should advise: "You can travel far, gain many merits, pay homage to various stupas and temples, see good communities, and gather much knowledge,

我若不老者，亦復欲去。」
If I were not old, I would also like to go."

若比丘共住弟子有事，
If a monk living with a disciple has a matter,

不自送、不使人送者，得越毘尼罪。
and does not send them themselves or have someone else send them, they violate Vinaya rules.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One said.



，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti.

爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼十法不滿，度弟子不教誡，

At that time, the nun Sruna Nanda was lacking the ten precepts, and she failed to instruct her disciples.

如天牛、天羊，乃至比丘尼語言：「阿梨耶！汝十法不具足，度弟子何不教誡使如法？」

Like heavenly cattle and sheep, until the nuns said, "Ariya! You lack the ten precepts; why do you not instruct your disciples to follow the rules?"

偷蘭難陀言：「汝妬我度弟子而責數我。」

Sruna Nanda said, "You are jealous of my disciples and continually reproach me."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。

The nuns spoke to the Great Loving Path, who then reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」

The Buddha said, "Call that nun to come here."

來已，問言：「汝實爾不？」

After she came, (He) asked, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，乃至汝云何十法不具、度弟子不教誡而嫌責他？

The Buddha said, "This is a bad matter. How can you, lacking the ten precepts and not instructing your disciples, reproach others?

從今已後不聽嫌他。」

From now on, you are not allowed to reproach others."

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，

The Buddha told Mahaprajapati Gautami, "Gather all the nuns residing in the city of Sravasti,

乃至已聞者當重聞。

so that those who have heard may hear again.

若比丘尼語比丘尼作是語：『阿梨耶！十法不具足度弟子應教誡。』

If a nun speaks to another nun saying, 'Ariya! You lack the ten precepts; you should instruct your disciples.'

而反嫌責者，波夜提。」

And instead she reproaches them, it is an offense of expiation."


比丘尼者，若僧、若眾多人、若一人。
A bhikkhuni may be a member of the Sangha, a multitude of people, or an individual.




是比丘尼者，如偷蘭難陀比丘尼。
This refers to a bhikkhuni, like the bhikkhuni Thullananda.




十法不具者，十法不成就。  
One who lacks ten methods does not achieve ten accomplishments.




度弟子者，受具足。
To be a pupil means to receive completeness.




作是諫時而嫌責者，波夜提。
If one admonishes this way and criticizes, it is a pārājika.

波夜提者，如上說。
A pārājika is as explained above.




比丘如是者，越毘尼罪。
If a monk acts in this way, he transgresses the disciplinary rules.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World Honored One spoke.



，爾時有學戒尼語偷蘭難陀言：「阿梨耶！我學戒滿，與我受具足。」  
Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, and at that time, a novice nun said to Venerable Ananda, "Venerable! I have completed my training, give me full ordination."

答言：「可爾。」後學戒尼言：「阿梨耶！我學戒滿，與我受具足。」  
He replied, "Alright." Later, the novice nun said, "Venerable! I have completed my training, grant me full ordination."

聞是語已，自不與受、不使人受，又不發遣。  
After hearing these words, he neither granted her nor ordered someone else to ordain her, nor did he dismiss her.

諸比丘尼言：「汝先許與受具足，何以不與？」  
The other nuns said, "You previously promised to give her full ordination, why don't you?"

聞此語猶故不與。  
Upon hearing these words, he still did not grant it.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事具白世尊。  
The other nuns spoke to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, and she reported the matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已問言：「汝實爾不？」  
The Buddha said, "Call that nun here." When she came, he asked, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」  
She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何許他受具足而不與受？從今已後不聽。」  
The Buddha said, "This is a wrong action, how can you promise full ordination and not give it? From now on, this is not allowed."

佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。」  
The Buddha told Mahāprajāpatī, "Gather all the nuns residing in Shravasti, even those who have heard this should hear it again."

若比丘尼語式叉摩尼言：『學戒滿當與汝受具足。』後不與受、不使人受，又不遣去者，波夜提。  
If a nun says to a probationary nun, 'After completing the training, full ordination will be given to you,' but later does not grant it, does not cause someone to grant it, or does not dismiss her, it is a transgression.  




比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhuni, as mentioned above.




式叉摩尼者，隨順行十八事，二歲學。
Shikshamanira learns and follows eighteen practices, starting at the age of two.




作是語者，如偷蘭難陀比丘尼。
The one who speaks thus is like the nun Thief Ananda.




許與受具足，後不與受、不使人受，波夜提。

If one promises and accepts fully, but later does not give or accept, nor lets others accept, it is a transgression.

波夜提者，如上說。

The transgression is as stated above.




若比丘尼語式叉摩尼：「當與汝受具足。」
If a bhikkhuni says to a sikkhamana, "I will grant you full ordination."

若後無力者當使人受，若不自受、不使人受者，應語令去，更餘處受具足。
If later unable to ordain her herself due to lack of strength, she should have someone else ordain her; if she neither does it herself nor has someone else do it, she should inform her to leave and ordain elsewhere.

若比丘尼許式叉摩尼受具足，後不與受者，波夜提。
If a bhikkhuni permits a sikkhamana to receive full ordination but later does not grant it, it is an offense of expiation.

若比丘許沙彌受具足，後不與受者，得越毘尼罪。
If a bhikkhu permits a novice to receive full ordination but later does not grant it, it incurs a transgression of Vinaya.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.



，爾時跋陀羅伽毘梨比丘尼，載好上乘到親里家，為世人所嫌：「云何沙門尼出家，故如俗人載好上乘，多欲如是？」

When the Buddha resided in Vaishali, at that time, the Bhikshuni Bhadda Kapilani rode a fine vehicle to her family's house, and people criticized her: "How can a renunciant nun behave like a layperson by riding in such a fine vehicle? What a display of desire!"

諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道，大愛道即以是事具白世尊。

The other Bhikshunis heard and told Mahaprajapati, who then reported the matter to the World Honored One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」

The Buddha said, "Call this Bhikshuni here." When she came, he asked, "Is this true?" She replied, "Yes, it is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，從今已後不聽。」

The Buddha said, "This is inappropriate behavior. It will not be allowed from now on."

復次爾時釋種女比丘尼道路行，羸老病不及伴，後被賊，

Furthermore, at that time, a Sakya woman who had become a Bhikshuni was traveling on the road, weak, old, and ill, unable to keep up with her companions, and was later attacked by robbers.

乃至佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha then told Mahaprajapati, "Gather all the Bhikshunis who reside in Shravasti, and those who have already heard these teachings should hear them again.

若比丘尼不病載乘者，波夜提。」

If a Bhikshuni who is not ill rides a vehicle, it is an offense involving expiation.


比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhuni, as mentioned above.




病者，若老羸病、若樂人不能行，世尊說無罪。
For those who are ill, whether old, weak, or unable to walk, the World-Honored One says there is no fault.




乘者，八種，乃至船乘是名八種。
Among them, there are eight types, including the boat, making eight in total.




載者

The carrier

波夜提

Wave night mention




不聽不病比丘尼載乘，
Monks without illness and nuns are not allowed to ride vehicles,

病者不得載特牛乘，
The sick cannot ride special oxen,

得載牸牛車及雌馬駱駝。
But can ride cow carts and female horses or camels.

若病不覺雌雄無罪，
If the sick do not realize the gender of the animal, it is not a sin,

若乘船直度無罪。
If they take a direct crossing by boat, it is not a sin.

若上水、若下水作因緣受持得去。
If going upstream or downstream, they can use appropriate means to proceed.

若比丘不病載乘者，
If a monk without illness rides,

越毘尼罪。
It is a breach of the Vinaya rules.

是故世尊說。
Thus the World Honored One spoke.



不满意不羯磨，  
Not content nor performing Karmavachana,

和尚不教诫，  
The monk does not admonish,




弟子不随逐、
Disciples do not follow,

年年蓄弟子、
Year after year, disciples are gathered,




停宿受具足、  
Spend the night and receive completeness,  

有事不遣送、  
Do not send off if there is anything,  




嫌責許具足、  
You find fault with Xujuzu,

載乘最在後。  
he lags behind the procession.




The eleventh path finally ends.




佛住毘舍離，爾時跋陀羅伽比梨比丘尼持傘蓋、著革屣，往親里家，為世人所嫌：「云何沙門尼似如俗人如是多欲？」

Buddha was staying in Vaishali when Bhaddā Kāpilāni, a Bhikkhuni, went to her relatives carrying an umbrella and wearing leather shoes, causing people to criticize: "How can a nun behave like a worldly person with such desires?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。

The other Bhikkhunis told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, who then went to inform the Blessed One about this matter.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」

The Buddha said, "Call this Bhikkhuni here." When she came, he asked, "Is this true?" She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「從今已後不聽持傘蓋革屣。」

The Buddha said, "From now on, holding umbrellas and wearing leather shoes will not be allowed."

復次佛住舍衛城，釋種女摩羅女先是樂人，出家道路行，時天極熱甚大疲苦。

Later, while Buddha was residing in Shravasti, a Shakyan woman named Mallikā who was formerly a musician, became exhausted from the intense heat while traveling after renouncing the world.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。

The Bhikkhunis spoke to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī about it, who then reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後聽病時。」

The Buddha said, "From today onwards, it is allowed during sickness."

佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī, "Gather all the Bhikkhunis residing around Shravasti, even those who have heard it before, to hear it again."

若比丘尼不病，持傘蓋、著革屣者，波夜提。」

If a Bhikkhuni is not sick and carries an umbrella or wears leather shoes, it will be considered an offense."




比丘尼者，如上說。
A bhikkhuni is as described above.




病者，老羸病尫弱，世尊說無罪。
The sick, the old and frail, the ill and weak, the World Honored One declares them blameless.




傘蓋者，樹皮蓋、多梨蓋、竹蓋、摩樓蓋、樹葉蓋、㲲傘蓋，如是比餘蓋等。
Umbrellas, such as those made of tree bark, many pear umbrellas, bamboo umbrellas, round tower umbrellas, tree leaf umbrellas, and silk umbrellas, among others.



革屣者，一重兩重。
Leather shoes, one layer upon another.




持者，受用，波夜提。  
To maintain is to make use and uphold the Precept.

波夜提者，如上說。  
The Precept, as mentioned above.




持蓋、不持革屣，越毘尼罪。
Holding a parasol, but not wearing leather sandals, is against the monastic code.

持革屣、不持傘蓋，亦越毘尼罪。
Wearing leather sandals, but not holding a parasol, also violates the monastic code.

二俱持者，波夜提。
Having both is subject to a minor infraction.

二俱不持者無罪。
Having neither incurs no infraction.

若比丘持莊嚴傘蓋、兩重革屣者，越毘尼罪。
If a monk holds an ornate parasol and wears double-layered leather sandals, it violates the monastic code.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One said.



住毘舍離，爾時跋陀羅伽比梨比丘尼往至親里家，
The Buddha was staying in Vaishali, at that time Bhadraka Bhikkhuni went to her native home,

敷高脚佉啁羅床褥兩三重登上，
She arranged two or three layers of a high-legged bed and climbed up,

為世人外道所嫌：「云何沙門尼出家，猶如俗人多欲如是？」
and was criticized by outsiders: "How can a nun who has renounced the world behave like a worldly person with so many desires?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，
The other nuns told Mahaprajapati,

大愛道即以是事往白世尊。
and Mahaprajapati went to report this matter to the Buddha.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」
The Buddha said, "Call this nun here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」
When she came, he asked, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
She replied, "Yes, it is true."

佛言：「汝云何過量佉啁羅床上坐？從今已後不聽。」
The Buddha said, "Why do you use such excessive comforts like a high-legged bed? From now on, it is not allowed."

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：「依止毘舍離比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha told Mahaprajapati, "Gather all the nuns residing in Vaishali and even those who have heard it must hear it again."

若比丘尼過量佉啁羅床褥上若坐、若臥，波夜提。
If a nun sits or lies down on an excessively high-legged bed, it incurs a Pacittiya offense.



比丘尼者，如上說。  
Bhikkhuni, as mentioned above.




過量者，過八指。  
Those who exceed the limit, exceed eight fingers.




佉啁羅床褥者，佉啁羅十四種，乃至崩求羅。
The mattress types are Qizhuolo, Qizhuolo fourteen kinds, up to Bengqiuluo.




佉啁崩求羅床，若坐、若臥，波夜提。
A bed made of kāca grass, whether for sitting or lying, is considered a pācittiya offense.

波夜提者，如上說。
A pācittiya offense, as described above.




若竟日坐，一波夜提。
If a monk sits for a whole day, he incurs a pācittiya.

若起已更坐，隨坐得波夜提。
If he rises and sits again, each sit incurs a pācittiya.

若過量床，得埋脚坐。
If over the limit of the bed, it results in the "buried foot" sitting.

若比丘坐過量佉啁羅床上，越毘尼罪。
If a monk sits on a bed that's over the limit, it is a Vinaya offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One spoke.



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘尼共一床一敷眠，枕褥破裂床復折壞。
The Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī, and at that time six groups of bhikkhunis were sleeping together on one bed and one mat, with the pillows and bedding torn and the bed broken.

諸比丘尼以是因緣語大愛道，大愛道乃至佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」
The bhikkhunis spoke to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī about this matter, and Mahāpajāpatī reported it to the Buddha: "Call those bhikkhunis to come."

來已佛言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」佛言：「此是惡事。」
When they came, the Buddha said, "Is this true?" They replied, "Yes, it is true." The Buddha said, "This is a bad deed."

乃至佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
Then the Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī, "Gather all the bhikkhunis residing in Śrāvastī, and those who have already heard this should listen again."

若比丘尼同敷床褥臥，波夜提。
If a bhikkhuni sleeps on the same bed or mat with another, it is a Pācittiya offense.



同一敷

The same one applying

一覆

One covering

一床

One bed




床者，十四種，乃至脂蘭床，波夜提。
There are fourteen types of beds, including zhilanchuang and boyeti.

波夜提者，如上說。
Boyeti, as mentioned above.




不得同床臥，一床一人臥，
Sharing a bed is not allowed, one person per bed.

三坐床得二人臥，展脚不得過膝。
A bed for three people allows two to sleep, with legs not extending beyond the knees.

若方褥，三褥得二人臥，展脚不得過膝。
If it's a rectangular mat, three mats allow two to sleep, with legs not extending beyond the knees.

若地敷者，不得多取地，當相去一不舒手，自敷坐具而臥。
If laying directly on the ground, do not take up too much space; one's spread should not exceed an arm's length from another, using one's own sitting mat to sleep.

若寒時得上通覆於下人，各自別覆無罪。
If it is cold, one may cover up from above to below; having separate covers is not an offense.

若比丘共床臥，越毘尼罪。
If monks sleep together on a bed, it violates the Vinaya rules.

是故世尊說。
This is why the World-Honored One declared it.




，

The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī.

爾時伽梨比丘尼受僧房已閉戶而去，

At that time, the nun Kāli received a monastic cell, closed the door, and left.

後客比丘尼上座來次第與房，

Later, another visiting senior nun came in succession to receive the cell.

見戶閉即嫌言：「此僧房舍何以閉戶而去？」

On seeing the door closed, she complained, "Why is this monastic cell closed and left?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，

The other nuns informed Mahāprajāpatī Gotamī,

乃至佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」

and eventually told the Buddha, who said, "Call that nun here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」

When she came, he asked, "Is it true as they say?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "Yes, it is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，

The Buddha said, "This is a wrong action,

乃至汝云何僧房舍不捨閉戶而行？

How could you leave a monastic cell without relinquishing it and closing the door?

從今已後不聽。」

From now on, this will not be allowed."

佛告大愛道：

The Buddha told Mahāprajāpatī Gotamī:

「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，

"Gather all the nuns residing in Śrāvastī,

乃至已聞者當重聞。

so that those who have heard will hear again.

若比丘尼僧房床褥不捨而去，

If a nun does not relinquish a bed in a monastic cell when leaving,

波夜提。」

it will lead to a disciplinary offense (pācittiya)


比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhuni, as stated above.




僧人用的床和褥子，包括坐床、卧床、枕头和褥子。

The monk's bed and bedding include a sitting bed, a sleeping bed, a pillow, and a mattress.




不舍者，不还不白，余处去者，波夜提。
If one does not relinquish, does not return without acknowledging, and leaves some places, this is a pārājika offense.

波夜提者，如上说。
A pārājika offense, as stated above.



若比丘尼欲行去，當捨床褥與知床褥人已而去。
If a nun wishes to go, she must leave her bedding with the person responsible for such things before leaving.

若不捨而去者，波夜提。
If she does not leave it and goes, it is a half-month offense.

若房不空，尋有人住者，越毘尼罪。
If the room is not empty and a person is found staying there, it is a breach of the Vinaya.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.




，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti,

爾時竭住母比丘尼先不語，

At that time, the nun, the mother of Jiejude, did not speak first,

卒爾而入竭住父比丘房而摩其背，

Suddenly entered the room of the monk, the father of Jiejude, and rubbed his back,

即反顧視之，見已言：「咄！咄！遠我。」

Immediately turned around to look at her, and upon seeing her, said, "Hey! Hey! Stay away from me."

比丘尼言：「我先常與洗浴，今摩觸何苦？」

The nun said, "I often bathed you before, what harm is there in touching now?"

語言：「本是俗人，今日出家，不得如先。」

He replied, "Before I was a layperson, today I am ordained, it's not like before."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事往白世尊。

The other nuns told Maha Prajapati, who then reported the matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」

The Buddha said, "Call this nun to come here."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」

Upon arrival, he asked, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，乃至汝云何先不白入比丘精舍？

The Buddha said, "This is a bad act, and why did you enter the monk's monastery without prior announcement?"

從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。

From now on, it is not allowed. Those who have heard must hear again.

若比丘尼先不白、入比丘僧伽藍者，波夜提。」

If a nun enters the monk's monastery without prior announcement, it is an offense (Pācittiya). 




比丘尼者，如上說。
The bhikkhuni, as mentioned above.




比丘僧伽藍者，下至一比丘住處。
For a monastery, at least one monk must reside.

先不白者，先不語不呼。
Those who do not inform first, neither speak nor call.




入者，如竭住母比丘尼，波夜提。
If someone enters, it's like residing with the nun who is a mother, it is a defeat.

波夜提者，如上說。
A defeat, as mentioned above.




若比丘尼欲入比丘住處者，當到門屋應先白：「和南！比丘尼白入，願聽。」
If a bhikkhuni wishes to enter a bhikkhu's residence, she should first say at the door: "Namo! The bhikkhuni seeks permission to enter."

比丘當籌量。
The bhikkhu should consider.

若比丘尼賢善，自無事著衣服者，聽入。
If the bhikkhuni is virtuous and properly dressed, allow her to enter.

若有事或泥作或裸露，當語言：「姊妹！小住。」
If she is engaged in work or is improperly dressed, say: "Sister! Wait a moment."

應唱言：「諸長老！比丘尼欲入，各自著衣。」
It should be announced: "Elders! A bhikkhuni wishes to enter, please dress properly."

若比丘尼不善無威儀者，應語：「莫入，有事。」
If the bhikkhuni is not virtuous or lacks decorum, she should be told: "Do not enter, there is an issue."

若先不語最初入者，波夜提。
Entering first without notifying results in a minor offense.

後來者無罪。
Later entrants are blameless.

不白而入者，舉一足，越毘尼罪；兩足，波夜提。
Entering without permission, one foot incurs a minor offense; both feet incur a minor transgression.

若還去者，越毘尼罪。
Leaving thereafter incurs a minor transgression.

若比丘先不語而入比丘尼住處者，越毘尼罪。
If a bhikkhu enters a bhikkhuni's dwelling without prior announcement, he incurs a minor transgression.

應住門屋下，遣淨人女語。
He should stay under the entrance roof and send a clean person to speak.

是故世尊說。
Thus spoke the World-Honored One.




，爾時比丘尼在道行，暮至村中欲求宿處，至一家語婦人言：「借我宿處。」
Buddha was staying in Shravasti City, and at that time, a nun was traveling on the road. In the evening, she reached a village and sought a place to stay. She said to a woman in a house, "Lend me a place to stay."

婦人言：「我夫行去暮或能還。」比丘尼復重借言：「故當不來可寄一宿。」即與宿處。
The woman said, "My husband has gone out and may return in the evening." The nun asked again, "If he doesn't return, can I stay for a night?" She was then offered a place to stay.

夫主暮還，為結所使與婦共行欲事。比丘尼未離欲，聞聲不悅，還已語諸比丘尼，
The husband returned in the evening and wanted to engage in relations with his wife. The nun, not yet free from desires, was displeased upon hearing this and, having returned, spoke to the other nuns.

比丘尼語大愛道，乃至佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」
The nun spoke to Mahāpajāpatī and eventually to the Buddha, saying, "Call this nun here." Upon her arrival, he asked, "Is it true?" She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「汝云何知食家婬處宿？從今已後不聽。」
The Buddha said, "How can you stay in a house where couples engage in relations? From now on, it is not allowed."

復次佛住舍衛城，爾時諸比丘尼道路行，至暮於聚落中，遍求無丈夫家而不能得，
Again, when the Buddha was staying in Shravasti City, at that time, nuns were traveling on the road and reached a settlement at night, searching everywhere for a house without a man but could not find one.

便在巷陌邊宿。於夜暴風雨起，有諸年少來相侵，觸傷於梵行。
They then stayed at the side of a street. That night, a violent storm arose, and some young men came to harass them, violating their chastity.

諸比丘尼以是因緣語大愛道，乃至佛言：「從今日後除餘時，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The nuns reported this incident to Mahāpajāpatī and ultimately to the Buddha, who said, "From today onwards, except during certain times, those who have heard must hear again.

若比丘尼知食家婬處宿，除餘時，波夜提。
If a nun knowingly stays in a house where couples engage in relations, except during certain times, it constitutes a pārājikā (offense).

餘時者，風時、雨時、奪命時、傷梵行時，是名餘時。」
These certain times are during storms, rain, life-threatening situations, or when their chastity is at risk. These are called 'certain times.'



比丘尼者，如上說。
A bhikkhuni is as explained above.




若自知、若從他聞。

Like knowing yourself or hearing from others.




食者，女人是丈夫食。

The eater, the woman is food for the husband.

丈夫是女人食。

The husband is food for the woman.




家者，四種姓家。
A family is a family of four castes.




婬處者，夫婦宿處。
A place of lust is where husband and wife reside.

除餘時，波夜提。
Except during other times, it is an offense.

餘時世尊說無罪。
During other times, the Blessed One says it is blameless.

風時、雨時、失命時、疑男子傷梵行時，是名餘時。
Times of wind, rain, impending death, or suspicion of a man's broken celibacy are called other times.




不得知食家婬處宿，

If you do not know if it is a house of prostitution, you can stay there.

若疑是聚落中有放蕩男子，

If you suspect there is a libertine in the town,

畏宿者無罪。

the fearful lodger is not guilty.

是故世尊說。

Thus spoke the World-Honored One.




，爾時毘舍離比丘尼安居竟，欲向舍衛城禮拜世尊，

Buddha was staying in Shravasti, and at that time a Bhikkhuni from Vesali completed her retreat and wished to pay homage to the Blessed One in Shravasti.

到比丘精舍中：「和南！我聞尊者欲詣舍衛城禮拜世尊，審爾不？」

She went to the monks' quarters and asked, "Venerable, I heard you are going to Shravasti to pay homage to the Blessed One, is that true?"

答言：「何故問？」「我欲隨去。」

He replied, "Why do you ask?" "I wish to go along," she said.

比丘言：「世尊制戒不得與比丘尼共道行。」

The monk said, "The Blessed One has laid down a rule prohibiting monks from traveling with nuns."

又問：「何時當發？」答言：「某日。」

She further asked, "When will you depart?" He replied, "On a certain day."

即記識其日，預持衣鉢於路側而待。

She noted the day, prepared her robes and bowl, and waited by the roadside.

比丘至其日食已而去，見比丘尼並相謂言：「此比丘尼欲隨我等去，當急脚行。」

On the day of departure, the monk finished his meal and set off, noticing the nun he said to his companions, "This nun wishes to follow us, we should walk quickly."

諸年少比丘尼奔走而逐，諸老病樂人不能得及，於後為賊所剝。

The younger nuns ran to keep up, but the elderly and infirm could not catch up and were later robbed by thieves.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道以是因緣往白世尊，

The nuns reported this to Mahāprajāpatī, who then related the incident to the Blessed One.

乃至「呼是比丘尼來。」來已，佛問：「汝實爾不？」

He asked them to call the Bhikkhuni, and upon her arrival, the Buddha asked, "Is it true as they say?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "Yes, it is true."

佛言：「汝云何無商人伴，於空逈處向餘國行？

The Buddha said, "Why did you travel to another country without a merchant escort in such a deserted place?

從今已後不聽。」

From now on, this is not allowed."

佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha instructed Mahāprajāpatī, "Gather all the nuns residing in Shravasti, so even those who have heard may hear again.

若比丘尼無商人伴向異國行，波夜提。」

If a Bhikkhuni travels to another country without a merchant escort, it results in a disciplinary offense.


比丘尼者，如上說。

A Bhikkhuni refers to what was said above.




無伴者，無商人伴。
Those who are alone have no business companions.




餘國者，異王境界。  
Yu guo zhe, yi wang jing jie.  
The remaining country is a different king's realm.

去者，波夜提。  
Qu zhe, bo ye ti.  
Those who leave are destined for Pohjati.




若比丘尼欲行時，當先求商人伴。
If a nun wants to travel, she should first seek a merchant companion.

若前人言：「阿梨耶！但來，我當料理使令得去。」當相望其人。
If someone ahead says, "Arya! Just come, I will arrange things so you can go," she should observe that person.

若語大善、視瞻不好者，不應隨去，更求善人將女婦者共去。
If the person speaks well but looks unkind, she should not follow, but seek a good person, preferably a woman, to go together.

若去時卒不得善察，至逈處方覺者，不得便捨去，當待近聚落已方便捨去。
If she fails to discern during the journey and realizes the danger in a remote place, she should not abandon the plan rashly but wait until near a settlement to leave conveniently.

若問言：「欲那去？」當語言：「我乞食耳。」
If asked, "Where do you want to go?" she should reply, "I am just going to beg for alms."

若比丘尼無商人伴行者，得越毘尼罪。
If a nun travels without a merchant companion, she incurs a Vinaya offense.

至所在，波夜提。
At her destination, there is a minor offense.

若比丘於空逈無商人伴行者，得越毘尼罪。
If a monk travels in desolate areas without a merchant companion, he incurs a Vinaya offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One spoke.



佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼共女人，共到園池處看。
The Buddha was staying in the city of Shravasti. At that time, the bhikkhunis went with women to see the gardens and ponds.

諸女人在水邊飲食，比丘尼往故村舍中看。
The women ate and drank by the water's edge, while the bhikkhunis went to look at the old village houses.

時有諸年少從林中出擾亂比丘尼。
At that moment, some young men came out from the forest and harassed the bhikkhunis.

比丘尼語大愛道，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The bhikkhunis spoke to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, saying that those who had heard should hear again.

「若比丘尼自境界內觀園林故墟，波夜提。」
"If a bhikkhuni observes gardens and old settlements within her boundaries, it is a pārājika offense."



比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhuni are as stated above.




境界內者，自王境內。
For those within the boundaries, they belong to the kingdom.




園者，菴婆羅園，乃至阿提目多園。
The garden, it was Ambavana, and even the Anjatamuta garden.




林者，種種林樹。
A forest, a variety of trees.




故墟者，空屋宅中。
The old ruins are among empty houses.




觀察離去者，名為“波夜提”。

Observe the one who departs, called "Bo Ye Ti".

波夜提者，如此所言。

Bo Ye Ti is as described above.




若比丘尼往園林墟宅中看，去時越毘尼罪；
If a nun goes to gardens or deserted houses, she commits a Vinaya offense by going;

到彼，波夜提。
Upon arriving there, it is a pācittiya offense.

若檀越婦女請共去者，無罪。
If she is invited by a laywoman, there is no offense.

若比丘往丘墟園林觀看為樂者，越毘尼罪。
If a monk goes to ruins or gardens for enjoyment, it is a Vinaya offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One said.



佛住毘舍離，爾時須闍提比丘尼是優陀夷本二。
The Buddha lived in Vaishali, where the nun Sujata had a past connection with Udita.

語優陀夷言：「尊者！我明日當守房，可來看。」
She said to Udita, "Venerable sir! I will stay in the room tomorrow, you may come to see."

時比丘尼盡入聚落乞食，時優陀夷著衣持鉢入比丘尼精舍，二人共在房後，各出身坐蹲踞相向欲心相視。
When the nuns went into the village to beg for food, Udita entered the nunnery with his robe and bowl, and the two of them sat behind a room, each squatting and looking at each other with desire.

時有老病比丘尼出欲便利，見已羞慚却行而去，以是因緣語大愛道，乃至佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」
At that time, an old and sick nun came out wanting to relieve herself, and seeing this, she was ashamed and went back. Because of this incident, she spoke to Mahaprajapati, and eventually, the Buddha said, "Call this nun here."

來已佛言：「此是惡事，乃至已聞者當重聞。若比丘尼共一比丘空靜處坐，波夜提。」
After she arrived, the Buddha said, "This is a bad deed, and those who have heard of it should be reminded. If a nun sits in a secluded place with a monk, it is a breach of the rule (Pācittiya)."




一者，共一比丘，更無人。

First, there is only one monk together, and no one else. 

設有人，眠醉、狂癡、心亂、苦痛、嬰兒、非人、畜生，故名為一。

If there is a person who is asleep, drunk, crazy, confused, in pain, a baby, not human, or an animal, it is still considered as one.



空寂的地方，在无人的角落避开。

A quiet place, hiding in an empty corner.




坐者，共坐，波夜提。

Sitting together, entails an offense of expiation.

波夜提者，如上說。

An offense of expiation, as explained above.




若比丘尼共比丘竟日坐，一波夜提。
If a nun sits with a monk for a whole day, it constitutes an offense.

若中間起還坐，隨坐一一波夜提。
If they get up in between and sit again, each sitting constitutes an offense.

若比丘尼獨在房中坐，卒有比丘來入坐者，比丘尼當速起。
If a nun is sitting alone in a room and suddenly a monk enters, the nun should quickly stand up.

欲起時當先語，勿使比丘怪。
Before standing, she should speak first to avoid the monk's suspicion.

若言：「何故起？」當語：「世尊制戒，我不得共比丘獨坐。」
If asked, "Why are you standing up?" she should reply, "The World-Honored One has ordained that I should not sit alone with a monk."

若減七歲男亦犯。
If the boy is under seven years old, it's still an offense.

齊幾時名坐？如取食乞出家人頃。
How long is considered as sitting? As long as it takes for a monastic to beg for food.

若有淨人作事行來出入不斷無罪。
If there is a layperson coming and going without interruption, there is no offense.

若房戶向道有行人，不斷者無罪。
If the door faces the path and there are passersby who do not stop, there is no offense.

若行人斷者，波夜提。
If the passersby stop, it constitutes an offense.

若淨人眠時，當彈指令覺，若在閣上下人見，若在閣下上人見，三人展轉相見無罪。
If the layperson is sleeping, snap fingers to wake them. If seen on the upper floor by people below, or on the lower floor by people above, if three people see each other in turn, there is no offense.

或見非聞、或聞非見、或亦見亦聞、或非見非聞。
Either seen and not heard, or heard and not seen, or both seen and heard, or neither seen nor heard.

見非聞者，遙見比丘、比丘尼坐不聞語聲。
Seen but not heard means seeing a monk or nun sitting without hearing any conversation.

聞非見者，聞語聲而不見。如是廣說。
Heard but not seen means hearing conversation but not seeing anyone. This is explained in detail.

見而不聞，越毘尼罪。
Seeing and not hearing is a minor offense.

聞而不見，亦越毘尼罪。
Hearing and not seeing is also a minor offense.

見聞，無罪。
Seeing and hearing, there is no offense.

非見非聞，波夜提。
Neither seeing nor hearing constitutes an offense.

是罪亦聚落、亦阿練若、亦晝、亦是夜、亦時亦非時、是覆處非露處、是一人非眾多，是近處非遠處。
This offense can occur in a village, a secluded place, during the day, or at night, whether at the right time or not, in a concealed place rather than an open place, and with one person rather than many, in a nearby place rather than a distant place.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One spoke.



佛住毘舍離，爾時跋陀羅比丘尼到親里家，共兄弟姊妹兒於屏處坐，比丘尼嫌言：
Buddha was residing in Vesālī, at that time, Bhadrā the nun went to her relatives' home and sat in a secluded place with brothers and sisters, as the nuns criticized:

「云何出家人與俗人隱處坐，猶如俗人？」
"How can a renunciant sit in a secluded place with laypeople, like a layperson?"

以是因緣語大愛道，乃至佛言：
Due to this reason, the matter was reported to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, and then to the Buddha, who said:

「從今已後不聽共男子屏處坐，乃至已聞者當重聞。
"From now on, it is not allowed to sit with men in a secluded place, and those who have already heard must hear again.

若比丘尼與丈夫屏處坐，波夜提。」
If a bhikkhuni sits in a secluded place with a man, it is a transgression (pācittiya)."



波夜提者，如上比丘中廣說。
The Bhikkhu mentioned above explains it extensively.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.




持伞伫床、   Waiting by the bed with an umbrella,

同敷床不舍、 Unwilling to leave the bed together,




不在白昼居住， 残村避无伴。

Not dwelling in daylight, Solitary in desolate village.




比丘靜處坐、  
Monks sit in quiet places,

男子亦復然。  
Men do so as well.




十二跋渠竟。
Twelve channels have been traversed.




佛住毘舍離，爾時跋陀羅比丘尼到親里家，
The Buddha was residing in Vaishali, when Bhadda the Bhikkhuni went to her relatives' home,

與兄弟姊妹兒，申手內住共耳語，
She conversed with her siblings intimately, whispering privately,

奴婢嫌言：「此出家人耳語，正當說我等過。」
The servants complained, saying, "This renunciant is whispering, surely speaking of our faults."

諸比丘尼聞已，語大愛道：「瞿曇彌！乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Bhikkhunis heard and told Mahapajapati, "Gotami! As you have heard before, you should hear again.

若比丘尼與男子申手內住若耳語，波夜提。」
If a Bhikkhuni converses intimately in whispers with a man, it is an offense (to be confessed)."




比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhunis, as mentioned above.




申手內者，

Those who stretch out their hands,

共申手內住。

should stay with hands outstretched.




耳語者

The whisperer

耳邊共語

Speaking by the ear

波夜提

Poyeti




比丘尼不得與男子申手內住共語若耳語，若欲共語者，當在申手外。
Bhikkhunis should not converse or whisper with men within arm's reach; if they want to converse, they should do so outside arm's reach.

若欲論密事，當隔籬、隔壁、隔樹、隔縵。
If they want to discuss confidential matters, they should be separated by a fence, wall, tree, or curtain.

比丘尼，波夜提。
For bhikkhunis, this is a Pācittiya offense.

比丘與女人申手內住共耳語，越毘尼罪。
A bhikku who whispers to a woman within arm's reach commits a Vinaya offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.




，爾時跋陀羅比丘尼到親里家，

The Buddha was staying in Vaishali, at that time Bhaddā the nun went to her relatives' home,

與兄弟姊妹兒在闇處無燈，先不語卒爾而入，

with her siblings and relatives in a dark place without light, she suddenly entered without speaking first,

爾時親里羞慚。

at that time her relatives felt ashamed.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，乃至答言：「實爾。」

The nuns spoke to Mahāprajāpatī, up to the point where she answered, "Indeed."

佛言：「汝云何知男子在闇中無燈而入？

The Buddha said, "How come you enter when men are in the dark without light?

從今已後不聽。

From now on, this is not permitted.

乃至已聞者當重聞。

Even those who have heard this before must hear it again.

若比丘尼知闇中有男子坐無燈而入，波夜提。」

If a nun knows that there is a man sitting in the dark and enters without light, it is a Pācittiya offense."



比丘尼者，如上說。
A bhikkhuni is as explained above.




男子坐者，常眠臥處。
The man sits where he often lies down to sleep.




黑暗中的人，是无法看到的地方。

In the darkness, there are places that cannot be seen.




無燈者，無油燈及餘種種燈。
Those without lamps are without oil lamps and various other kinds of lamps.

入者，波夜提。
Entering, Bhikkhu.

波夜提者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as mentioned above.




不得入闇地男子坐處
Do not enter a dark place where a man is sitting.

若有因緣事須入者，若聞內人高聲大聲當入。
If there is a reason that necessitates entering and you hear someone inside speaking loudly, you may enter.

若不聞語者，應先遣人語、若彈指、若作燈明現相，有人呼入者當入。
If you do not hear speaking, you should first send someone to speak, snap fingers, or show a light. Enter if someone calls you in.

若不語、不彈指、不作燈明而入者，波夜提。
If you enter without speaking, snapping fingers, or showing a light, it is an offense (Pācittiya).

若比丘不語而入者，越毘尼罪。
If a monk enters without speaking, it is a violation (Vinaya).

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.



，爾時六群比丘尼先到作伎樂處占顧坐處，伎兒戲時高聲大笑，眾人效笑。
The Buddha was staying in Rajagriha, at that time six groups of nuns reached the place of entertainment first and occupied the seats, the performers laughed loudly while performing, and the audience followed in laughter.

人笑時便復默然，似如坐禪人；笑適止，還復拍手大笑。
When people laughed, the nuns sat silently like those in meditation; once the laughter stopped, they clapped their hands and laughed loudly again.

於是眾人捨伎兒而觀比丘尼。
As a result, people abandoned watching the performers and instead watched the nuns.

時伎兒不得雇直，瞋恚嫌責：「坐是沙門尼，令我失雇直。」
At that time, the performers did not receive payment and angrily complained, "It's because those nuns are sitting there, causing me to lose my fee."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，乃至答言：「實爾。」
The nuns spoke to Mahaprajapati, and she replied, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何觀伎樂？從今已後不聽觀伎樂。
The Buddha said, "This is improper behavior. How can you watch performances? From now on, you are not permitted to watch performances.

乃至已聞者當重聞。若比丘尼觀伎樂行，波夜提。
This should be emphasized repeatedly to those who have already heard it. If a nun watches a performance, it is a breach of the rule, an offense of pācittiya."



比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikkhuni, as mentioned above.




伎樂者，舞伎、歌伎、鐃盤、打鼓如是一切，下至四人共戲，觀看者，波夜提。

Performers of arts include dancers, singers, cymbals, and drummers; all such performers, down to those playing together in a group of four, are watched by one called a poyapti.

波夜提者，如上說。

The term poyapti is as explained above.




，

One should not watch musical performances.

若比丘尼乞食，

If a nun is begging for food,

值王、王夫人、若天像出，

and happens to encounter a king, a queen, or a deity procession,

有伎樂者，

with musical performances,

遇見無罪。

there is no wrongdoing in witnessing it.

若下處就高，

If in a lower place moving upward,

作意闚望逐看，

intending to deliberately watch,

波夜提。

a transgression [is committed].

若檀越欲供養佛，

If a donor wishes to make offerings to the Buddha,

作眾伎樂、研香、結鬘，

by presenting various musical performances, preparing incense, and making garlands,

語比丘尼言：

and says to the nun,

「阿梨耶！佐我安施供養具。」

"Noble one! Help me arrange the offering items."

爾時得助作。

At that time, assistance can be given.

若於彼間聞樂，

If during that period one hears music,

有欲著心者當捨去。

those who develop attachment should let it go.

若比丘觀伎樂者，

If a monk watches musical performances,

越毘尼罪。

it is a violation of the Vinaya (discipline).

是故世尊說。

Therefore, the World-Honored One spoke


，爾時比丘尼諍鬪不和合住，

Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti when at that time Bhikshunis were quarreling and living in disharmony.

時大愛道瞿曇彌眾主僧諍事已起者不能滅，未起者不能令不起。

At that time, Mahaprajapati Gautami, the leader of the assembly, was unable to resolve disputes once they arose, nor prevent them from arising.

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。

Because of this, the Bhikshunis went to inform the World-Honored One.

佛言：「呼大愛道瞿曇彌來。」

The Buddha said, "Call Mahaprajapati Gautami to come."

來已，佛語瞿曇彌：「汝實爾不？」

After she came, the Buddha said to Gautami, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「汝云何諍事起而不斷滅，未起者不能方便令不起？

The Buddha said, "How is it that you cannot resolve disputes once they arise, nor prevent them from arising before they do?

從今日後諍事起當斷滅。」

From today onward, when a dispute arises, it must be resolved."

佛告大愛道：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told Mahaprajapati, "Gather all the Bhikshunis residing in the city of Sravasti, so those who have heard may hear again.

若比丘尼鬪諍不和合住，眾主不料理斷滅者，波夜提。」

If Bhikshunis quarrel and live in disharmony, and the leader does not manage to resolve it, it will lead to an offense


比丘尼者，如上說。
A bhikkhuni is as described above.




諍者，口諍。
The arguer argues with words.




鬪者，展轉取勝不和合住、是法非法、是毘尼非毘尼、是罪非罪、是輕是重、是可治是不可治、有殘無殘、如法羯磨非法羯磨、和合羯磨不和合羯磨、應羯磨不應羯磨、是處羯磨非處羯磨。
Combat involves striving for victory without harmony, discerning whether it is lawful or unlawful, whether it is the Vinaya or not, whether it is a crime or not, whether it is minor or serious, whether it is curable or incurable, whether there are remnants or not, whether the actions are legally valid or not, whether there is unity or conflict, whether the procedure is appropriate or inappropriate, whether the location for the procedure is suitable or unsuitable.




眾主者，眾之標望，得自從意。
The leader of the people is the hope of the masses, achieving by following their will.




不料理斷滅者，不自滅、不使人滅，波夜提。
Those who do not take care to cease, neither cease themselves nor cause others to cease, commit a pācittiya.

波夜提者，如上說。
A pācittiya is as described above.




若比丘尼鬪諍不和合住，不得視置，當料理斷滅，使展轉悔過。
If a nun is embroiled in disputes and does not harmoniously settle, she should not ignore it, and must address and extinguish it, making amends indirectly.

若復不止事，須羯磨者當集僧料理。
If the issue does not cease, a formal gathering of monks must be convened to address it.

若自不能者，當餘眾請有德比丘尼、若比丘、若優婆塞優婆夷令滅。
If one cannot resolve it herself, she should request virtuous nuns, monks, laymen, or laywomen to eliminate it.

若諍事難斷，當作是念：「眾生業行，待時、待熟自當滅。」
If the dispute is difficult to resolve, one should think: "Karmic actions of beings, in due time and when mature, will extinguish by themselves."

如是者無罪。
In doing so, there is no fault.

若比丘鬪諍，眾主不料理滅者，越毘尼罪。
If monks are embroiled in disputes and the leader of the assembly does not address and extinguish them, it is a breach of Vinaya rules.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One has spoken.



佛住毘舍離，

The Buddha was residing in Vaishali,

爾時有跋陀羅比丘尼，

At that time there was a nun named Bhadra,

到親里家觀看洗浴，

Who visited her family to take a bath,

諸婦人言：

The women said,

「我與阿梨耶揩身體，

"Please let us rub your body with oil, Arya,

使我得功德。」

So that we may gain merit."

此比丘尼端正，

This nun was very beautiful,

諸女人欲看其身體故，

The women wanted to see her body,

便聽使揩，

So she agreed to let them rub it,

即用種種香油塗身。

And they applied various fragrant oils on her body.

諸比丘尼嫌言：

Other nuns criticized her saying,

「出家人猶故多欲。」

"A renunciate still indulges in desires."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，

The nuns reported this to Mahaprajapati,

乃至答言：

Who responded:

「實爾。世尊！」

"It is indeed true, World-honored One!"

佛言：

The Buddha said,

「汝云何使俗人家婦女揩摩身體？

"How can you let laywomen massage your body?

從今日已後不聽。

From today onwards, this is not allowed.

乃至已聞者當重聞。

Those who have heard must hear it again.

若比丘尼使俗人婦女塗香油揩摩洗浴，

If a nun allows laywomen to apply oil and massage her,

除病時，

Except in the case of illness,

波夜提。」

It is a transgression."



比丘尼者，如上說。
As for the nuns, as stated above.




俗人婦女者，四種家女。
Ordinary women, are of four types from different families.




以種種香油揩摩洗浴。  
Bathe and massage with various aromatic oils.  




若老病者無罪。
If they are old or sick, there is no offense.

若不病揩摩洗浴，波夜提。
If not sick, anointing and bathing incur a Pācittiya offense.

波夜提者，如上說。
Pācittiya, as stated above.



若身體有瘡疥，得持藥揩摩洗浴；
If there are sores or scabies on the body, one can apply medicine and bathe;

若熱病得摩耶披屑塗；
If suffering from a fever, one can use moistened bran for relief;

若風病得以小麥屑塗，若雜病者以雜藥塗無罪。
If suffering from wind disease, use wheat bran; for other illnesses, using mixed medicine is not an offense.

塗已不得在眾人中住，當在邊房，病差洗已當入。
After application, one should not stay among others, but stay in a side room, and enter after washing when better.

若比丘不病，使俗人揩摩，越毘尼罪。
If a monk is not ill and allows a layperson to massage him, he transgresses the Vinaya rules.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.



佛住毘舍離，爾時世尊制戒，不聽俗人婦女揩摩洗浴。
The Buddha was residing in Vaishali, at that time the Blessed One established a rule, prohibiting laywomen from giving massages and baths.

時跋陀羅比丘尼使比丘尼揩摩，諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至已聞者當重聞。
Then the nun Bhadrā asked another nun to give a massage, and because of this incident, the nuns reported it to the Blessed One, and those who had heard of it before were to hear it again.

「若比丘尼不病，使比丘尼揩摩洗浴者，波夜提。」
"If a nun is not ill and asks another nun for a massage or bath, it is an offense of expiation."



若揩而不摩，越毘尼罪。
If rubbed but not massaged, it is a Vinaya offense.

摩而不揩，亦越毘尼罪。
Massaged but not rubbed, it is also a Vinaya offense.

二俱者，波夜提。
For both, it is a Pacittiya offense.

若比丘不病令比丘揩摩者，越毘尼罪。
If a non-sick monk makes another monk rub or massage, it is a Vinaya offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.



沙彌尼亦如是。
It is the same for the female novice.

乃至已聞者當重聞。
Even those who have heard it already should listen again.

「若比丘尼不病，令沙彌尼揩摩者，波夜提。」
"If a nun, not being ill, allows a novice to massage her, it is a Pācittiya offense."




沙弥尼者，随佛出家受十戒。
A sramanerika is one who leaves home to follow the Buddha and receives the ten precepts.




使揩摩者，如比丘尼中說。
The given lines refer to practices mentioned among nuns.




式叉摩尼亦如是。
The Śikṣamāṇā is also like this.

乃至已聞者當重聞。
As for those who have already heard, they should hear again.

「若比丘尼不病，令式叉摩尼揩摩者，波夜提。」
"If a nun who is not ill causes a Śikṣamāṇā to massage her, [it is an offense requiring confession (Pācittiya)]."




式叉摩尼者，隨順行十八事、二年學戒。
Shikshamana is one who follows the practice of eighteen matters and studies the precepts for two years.




使揩摩者，如上比丘尼中說。  
To authorize the one who administers the penance, as explained in the section about the nuns above.




俗人婦女亦如是。
The common women are also like this.

乃至已聞者當重聞。
Those who have heard it before should hear it again.

「若比丘尼不病，令俗人婦女揩摩者，波夜提。」
"If a bhikkhuni is not ill, and allows a laywoman to massage her, it is a Pācittiya offense."



俗人婦女者，四種姓家女人。
Laywomen are women from the four castes.




揩摩，如比丘尼中說。  
Ablution, as said among the nuns.




，爾時比丘尼僧集欲作布薩羯磨，

The Buddha was staying in Rajagaha, and at that time the bhikkhuni sangha assembled to perform the uposatha ceremony.

時樹提比丘尼不來，僧遣信喚言：「阿梨耶！比丘尼僧集欲作布薩，可來。」

Sthulananda Bhikkhuni did not come, so the sangha sent a messenger: "Arya! The bhikkhuni sangha has gathered to perform the uposatha, please come."

樹提言：「世尊制戒，世間清淨者得布薩，我即清淨，不能去。」

Sthulananda said: "The Blessed One has established rules, and only those who are pure in the world can participate in the uposatha. I am pure and cannot attend."

大愛道以是因緣具白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」

Mahapajapati Gotami reported this incident in full to the Blessed One, and he replied, “Indeed.”

佛言：「此是惡事，乃至汝不恭敬布薩，誰當恭敬？乃至已聞者當重聞。」

The Buddha said, "This is a serious matter. If you do not show respect to the uposatha, who will? Let those who have heard this, hear it anew."

若比丘尼半月清淨布薩，不恭敬者，波夜提。」

If within the half-month a bhikkhuni does not respect the uposatha ceremony, it is a pācittiya offense


淨心者故，我今亦如是。

The pure-hearted ones, accordingly, I am also like this.




不病比丘尼不來恭敬布薩者，波夜提。
If a nun who is not sick does not come to respectfully participate in the Uposatha ceremony, it is an offense.

病者，老羸病、服藥、刺頭出血、服酥，應與清淨欲。
For the sick, the elderly, those with chronic illness, those on medication, those with a head injury bleeding, or those taking ghee, they should be given a clean desire.

若不病不來，設病不與清淨欲，波夜提。
If one is not sick and does not come, or if one is sick and isn't given a clean desire, it's an offense.

若比丘尼不來布薩，病不與清淨欲，波夜提。
If a nun does not attend the Uposatha and isn't given the clean desire due to illness, it's an offense.

若比丘不來布薩，病不與欲，越毘尼罪。
If a monk does not attend the Uposatha and isn't given the desire due to illness, it is a vinaya offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.



申手內無燈、  
Though you extend your hand, there is no light within,

伎樂主不滅、  
The master of orchestration does not extinguish,




香油比丘尼、 
The sesame oil nun, 

沙彌尼學戒、 
Novice nun learning the precepts, 




女婦不布薩。
The woman does not perform the Buddhist ceremony.

十三跋渠竟。
Thirteen bridges are finished.




，爾時長老比丘教誡比丘尼。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti, during which time an elder monk was instructing the nuns.

爾時六群比丘不得教誡次，便作是言：「我等教誡去。」
At that time, a group of six monks, unable to instruct in order, said, "We must provide instruction."

又言：「世尊制戒，不聽不差而教誡。我等當出界外，展轉相拜而去。」
They also said, "The Blessed One has established rules, prohibiting unauthorized instruction. We shall go out of bounds, exchange greetings, and leave."

即出界外展轉相拜已，晨朝著衣往到比丘尼住處，語比丘尼言：「姊妹盡集，我當教誡。」
After exiting the boundaries and exchanging greetings, they donned their robes in the morning and proceeded to the nuns' dwelling, saying to the nuns, "Sisters assemble, I will instruct you."

時六群比丘尼即便速集，善比丘尼不來，而作是言：「我不能非毘尼人邊受教誡。」
At that time, the group of six nuns quickly gathered, but the virtuous nuns did not come, saying, "I cannot receive instruction from a non-Vinaya person."

時六群比丘共六群比丘尼作世俗語已，須臾間而去。
At that time, the group of six monks engaged in worldly talk with the group of six nuns, then left shortly after.

爾時長老難陀著衣持鉢，來到精舍言：「姊妹集僧，我欲教誡。」
Then, Elder Nanda donned his robe, took his alms bowl, arrived at the vihara, and said, "Sisters, assemble, I wish to instruct the community."

於是善比丘尼盡集，六群比丘尼不來。
Thus, the virtuous nuns all gathered, while the group of six nuns did not come.

長老問言：「比丘尼僧集未？」
The elder asked, "Has the community of nuns assembled?"

答言：「不集。」
They replied, "Not assembled."

「誰不集？」
"Who has not assembled?"

答言：「六群比丘尼。」
They replied, "The group of six nuns."

即遣信喚：「姊妹來！我欲教誡。」
He immediately sent a message, "Sisters, come! I wish to instruct."

答言：「我不去，已六群阿闍梨邊受教誡竟。」
The reply was, "I will not come, I have already received instruction from the group of six acharyas."

時長老言：「尼僧不和合。」
The elder said, "The nuns' community is not unified."

即起而去。
He then rose and left.

佛知而故問：「汝教誡何以速？」
The Buddha, knowing this, asked, "Why was your instruction so brief?"

答言：「世尊！我至時著衣往欲教誡，善比丘尼皆集，唯六群比丘尼不來，比丘尼僧不和合，故不得教誡。」
He replied, "Blessed One! When I arrived in my robe to instruct, the virtuous nuns all assembled, only the group of six nuns did not come. The nuns' community is not unified, hence the instruction was not possible."

佛言：「呼六群比丘尼來。」
The Buddha said, "Call forth the group of six nuns."

來已問言：「汝實爾不？」
When they arrived, he asked, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
They replied, "It is true."

乃至已聞者當重聞。
Until those who have already heard shall hear again.

「若比丘尼半月僧教誡，而不恭敬、不來，波夜提。」
"If a nun is instructed in the community every half-month and does not show respect or fails to attend, it is an offense."




比丘尼者，如上說。
Bhikshuni, as said above.




半月者，十四日、十五日。
Half a month means the 14th and 15th day.




僧教誡者，教誡比丘尼。
Monastic precepts teach the bhikkhunis.




不恭敬、不來者，波夜提。

For those who are disrespectful and do not appear, this is a transgression.

波夜提者，如上說。

As for this transgression, it is as explained above.




若老羸病、服藥、刺頭出血、服酥，應與欲，作是言：「我某甲與教誡欲。」
If elderly or sick, taking medicine, having bleeding from the head, or consuming ghee, permission should be granted, saying: "I, so-and-so, grant permission for admonition."

如是三說。若不病不去，病不與欲，波夜提。
Say it three times. If not sick and not leaving, or sick but not given permission, it is a transgression.

若至布薩日，應差比丘尼持欲詣僧，作如是言：「比丘尼僧和合，頭面禮比丘僧足，問布薩、請教誡。」
When it is the Uposatha day, a bhikkhuni should be delegated to bring the wish to the sangha, saying: "The bhikkhuni sangha is assembled, and we bow at the feet of the bhikkhu sangha to ask for Uposatha and request admonition."

如是三說。比丘僧中有教誡尼者，應語：「姊妹當住。」
Say it three times. If there is a bhikkhu among the sangha who instructs the nuns, he should say: "Sister, pay attention."

若有比丘成就十二法者，應羯磨教誡。
If there is a bhikkhu who is accomplished in the twelve principles, a formal act of admonition should be carried out.

若無者當語言：「無教誡比丘尼人，莫放逸！」
If there isn't, it should be said: "There is no instructing of the bhikkhuni, do not be heedless!"

是故世尊說也。
Thus, the World-Honored One has spoken.



佛住王舍城，爾時樹提比丘尼隱處生癰，諸比丘尼入聚落乞食，後有治癰師來。
Buddha resided in Rajagriha City, at that time Bhikkhuni Shutree developed a boil in a hidden place, and the other Bhikkhunis went to the village to beg for food; later, a healer arrived.

比丘尼言：「長壽！與我破癰。」答言：「可爾。」即與破癰瘡，著塗藥已而去。
The Bhikkhuni said, "Long life! Help me treat the boil." He replied, "Certainly." He treated the boil and applied medicine, then left.

諸比丘尼乞食還，見地膿血，問言：「此是何等膿血？」
When the Bhikkhunis returned from begging for food, they saw pus and blood on the ground and asked, "What is this pus and blood?"

答言：「我破癰瘡。」
The answer was, "I treated the boil."

諸比丘尼嫌言：「汝云何隱處有癰，不白善比丘尼而破？」
The Bhikkhunis reproached, saying, "How could you have a boil in a hidden place and not inform the senior Bhikkhuni before treating it?"

諸比丘尼語大愛道，乃至答言：「實爾。世尊！」
The Bhikkhunis spoke to Mahāprajāpatī, even replied, "Indeed, it is so, World-Honored One."

佛言：「汝云何膝以上肩以下有癰瘡，先不白聽而破癰？從今已後不聽。」
Buddha said, "How could you have a boil above the knee and below the shoulder and treat it without prior notification? From now on, it is not allowed."

乃至已聞者當重聞。
Even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘尼膝以上、肩以下隱處有癰瘡，先不白聽，男子破洗者，波夜提。
If a Bhikkhuni has a boil in a hidden place above the knee and below the shoulder and a man treats or cleans it without prior notification, it is a Pācittiya offense.



Bhikshuni, as stated above.

如是我聞：一時，佛住舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。

Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying in the Jeta Grove, Anathapindika's Park in Shravasti.

爾時，世尊告諸比丘：

At that time, the World-Honored One addressed the bhikshus:

我行道時，有五過失，五成就。

There are five faults and five achievements when I practice the path.

云何為五？

What are the five?

行時失威儀，不察身行，不知足，不離欲，心不一境。

Failing in deportment while walking, not observing bodily actions, not knowing contentment, not abandoning desires, the mind not focused on one object.

是為行道五過失。

These are the five faults of practicing the path.

云何為五成就？

What are the five achievements?

行時威儀成就，察身行，知足，離欲，心一境性。

Achieving deportment while walking, observing bodily actions, knowing contentment, abandoning desires, the mind focused in singularity.

是為行道五成就。

These are the five achievements of practicing the path.



膝已上者，髀已上。
Above the knee, above the thigh.




肩已下者，乳房已下。
Those with lowered shoulders have drooping breasts.




First, those who are not pure, are not pure good nuns.




聽者，不僧中作求聽羯磨。

Listeners, do not request consent for a karma act within the Sangha.

隱處有癰欲破癰者，應先僧中作求聽羯磨。

If there is a boil in a private area that needs treatment, one should first seek permission from the Sangha.

羯磨者應作是說：「阿梨耶僧聽！某甲比丘尼隱處有癰，若僧時到，僧某甲比丘尼，欲從僧乞破癰羯磨。

The karma act should be stated as follows: "Venerable Sangha, listen! There is a boil in a private area of the nun named X. If the time is suitable, the nun wishes to request the Sangha for a karma act to treat the boil.

阿梨耶僧聽某甲比丘尼欲從僧乞破癰羯磨，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」

Venerable Sangha, listen, as the nun named X wishes to request the Sangha for a karma act to treat the boil, and the Sangha remains silent, this matter is approved.

若隱處有癰者，當令可信人、若依止弟子、若同和上阿闍梨，以錐、若指甲破之以藥塗。

If there is a boil in a private area, a trustworthy person, a disciple upon request, or an accompanying instructor should be allowed to treat it with a needle or nails and apply medicine.

若使男子破癰，波夜提。

If a man is employed to treat the boil, it incurs a minor infraction (Pācittiya).

波夜提者，如上說。

A minor infraction is as previously described.



若肩已上、膝已下有癰瘡，

If there are sores from the shoulders up or from the knees down,

若欲刺頭出血、若欲刺臂，

If you want to prick the head to bleed or want to prick the arm,

當使婦女人急按，

Let a woman urgently press,

男子破無罪。

A man breaking is without guilt.

是故世尊說。

Therefore, the World Honored One said.




與時病人。棄捐賜。或復壞失

Giving to the sick at the time, what is discarded or lost

減損不淨犍度最初

Diminishing the impure maxims from the beginning

波羅夷本四相調意

The foundation of the Parajika with four aspects in mind

不以點心食變情無犯

No offense when feeding on impurity with a transformed mind
