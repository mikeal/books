A Buddha named "Shakyamuni" (meaning "Sage of the Shakya Clan") appears ~500BC (dates are tricky this far back). This name comes from this living Buddha being born Siddhartha Gautama, prince of the Shakya clan.

Being this Buddha he teaches in many regions of India with large procession of followers. After this living Buddha's death, his followers continue his teachings and traditions until the present day.

When these followers first assembled following this death the monk Ananda, also born into the Shakya clan (Siddhartha's cousin) was able to recite the teachings from memory. Of a noble birth, trained in memorization, recitation, and the structure of mnemonics, Ananda had been transmitting the teaching this way for some time.

Sariputra was another of the Buddha's followers, known for his wisdom and insight. Even in the Buddha's lifetime, Sariputra was began to assemble the Buddha's teachings into a structured form.

The Buddha had many notable senior disciples, but Ananda and Sariputra become the most notable after his death because they are the more directly involved in the forms of transmission and preservation that persist in more or the less the same form to the present day.

By the second time the Buddha's followers meet after his death, they begin to assemble the teachings into collections. It is also at this time that the first sectarian divisions begin to appear. Over the coming centuries, these divisions will continue and each division will maintain its own collection of teachings.

These teachings are maintained by both an oral and, eventually, a written tradition. While preservation is a primary concern, the teachings are also subject to interpretation,elaboration, and the influence of cultures in which they are transmitted.

Ananda's teachings ("Thus have I heard,") are first collected in written form as "Connected" (sanskrit:saṃyukta, pali:saṃyutta) discourses, and Sariputra's systems form the basis of Abdhidharma.

With each sect maintaining its own collection of teachings there is not single canonical
