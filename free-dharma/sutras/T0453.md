佛說彌勒下生經
Buddha Speaks of Maitreya's Descent Sutra

西晉月氏三藏竺法護譯
Translated by Tripitaka Master Dharmarakṣa of the Western Jin Dynasty

聞如是：
Thus I have heard:

一時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園，與大比丘眾五百人俱。
At one time, Buddha was in Jeta Grove, Anathapindika's Park, Savatthi, with a great assembly of 500 monks.

爾時，阿難偏露右肩，右膝著地，白佛言：「如來玄鑒，無事不察，當來、過去、現在三世，皆悉明了；過去諸佛姓字、名號，弟子、菩薩、翼從多少，皆悉知之；一劫、百劫、若無數劫，皆悉觀察，亦復如是；國王、大臣、人民姓字則能分別；如今現在國界若干亦復明了。將來久遠彌勒出現，至真、等正覺，欲聞其變，弟子、翼從，佛境豐樂，為經幾時？」

爾時，阿難偏露右肩，右膝著地，
At that time, Ānanda bared his right shoulder, kneeled with his right knee on the ground,

白佛言：「如來玄鑒，無事不察，
and addressed the Buddha, saying: "Tathāgata, your profound insight discerns all without exception.

當來、過去、現在三世，皆悉明了；
The past, future, and present—all are clearly known.

過去諸佛姓字、名號，弟子、菩薩、翼從多少，皆悉知之；
The names and titles of past Buddhas, their disciples, bodhisattvas, and retinues, all are known.

一劫、百劫、若無數劫，皆悉觀察，亦復如是；
One kalpa, a hundred kalpas, innumerable kalpas, all are observed with clarity.

國王、大臣、人民姓字則能分別；
The names of kings, ministers, and people are clearly distinguished.

如今現在國界若干亦復明了。
As for the present state of the realms, all are likewise clear.

將來久遠彌勒出現，至真、等正覺，
In the distant future, when Maitreya appears as a supreme, perfectly enlightened one,

欲聞其變，弟子、翼從，佛境豐樂，為經幾時？」
I wish to hear of these changes—his disciples, retinue, the splendor of his realm, and its duration."

佛告阿難：「汝還就坐，聽我所說彌勒出現國土豐樂、弟子多少。善思念之，執在心懷。」
Buddha said to Ānanda: "Return to your seat, listen to my account of Maitreya's future realm of joy and disciples. Reflect well, hold it in your heart."

是時，阿難從佛受教，即還就坐。
At that time, Ānanda, receiving the Buddha's instruction, immediately returned to his seat.

爾時，世尊告阿難曰：「將來久遠於此國界當有城郭名曰翅頭，東西十二由旬，南北七由旬，土地豐熟，人民熾盛，街巷成行。爾時，城中有龍王名曰水光，夜雨香澤，晝則清和。是時，翅頭城中有羅剎鬼名曰葉華，所行順法不違正教，每向人民寢寐之後，除去穢惡諸不淨者；常以香汁而灑其地，極為香淨。

爾時，世尊告阿難曰：
At that time, the World-Honored One spoke to Ānanda:

「將來久遠於此國界當有城郭名曰翅頭，
"In the distant future, in this realm, there will be a city named Ketumati,

東西十二由旬，南北七由旬，
twelve yojanas east to west, seven yojanas north to south,

土地豐熟，人民熾盛，街巷成行。
with fertile land, thriving people, and orderly streets.

爾時，城中有龍王名曰水光，
At that time, in the city, there will be a dragon king named Water Light,

夜雨香澤，晝則清和。
who rains fragrant moisture at night and keeps the air clear by day.

是時，翅頭城中有羅剎鬼名曰葉華，
Also in Ketumati, there will be a rākṣasa named Leaf Flower,

所行順法不違正教，
who acts according to the Dharma, never violating the true teachings.

每向人民寢寐之後，除去穢惡諸不淨者；
Each night after the people have gone to sleep, he removes all impurities and defilements;

常以香汁而灑其地，極為香淨。」
and constantly sprinkles fragrant water, making the land exceedingly pure."

「阿難當知，爾時閻浮地東西南北千萬由旬，諸山河石壁皆自消滅，四大海水各減一萬。時閻浮地極為平整，如鏡清明。舉閻浮地內穀食豐賤，人民熾盛，多諸珍寶。諸村落相近，鷄鳴相接。是時，弊華果樹枯竭，穢惡亦自消滅；其餘甘美果樹、香氣殊好者皆生于地。

「阿難當知，
"Ānanda, you should know,

爾時閻浮地東西南北千萬由旬，
at that time, Jambudvīpa will extend thousands of yojanas in all directions,

諸山河石壁皆自消滅，四大海水各減一萬。
the mountains, rivers, and stone walls will all disappear, and the waters of the four great seas will recede by ten thousand.

時閻浮地極為平整，如鏡清明。
Jambudvīpa will become extremely flat, as clear as a mirror.

舉閻浮地內
Throughout Jambudvīpa,

穀食豐賤，人民熾盛，多諸珍寶。
grain will be abundant and cheap, people will flourish, and there will be many treasures.

諸村落相近，鷄鳴相接。
The villages will be close to each other, with the crowing of roosters overlapping.

是時，弊華果樹枯竭，穢惡亦自消滅；
At that time, the harmful fruit trees will wither, and impurities will also disappear;

其餘甘美果樹、香氣殊好者皆生于地。」
while all the other sweet and fragrant fruit trees will grow from the earth."

「爾時，時氣和適四時順節，人身之中無有百八之患：貪欲、瞋恚、愚癡、不大慇懃。人心均平，皆同一意，相見歡悅，善言相向。言辭一類無有差別，如彼優單越人而無有異。是時，閻浮地內人民大小皆同一向，無若干之差別也。彼時，男女之類意欲大小便時地自然開，事訖之後地便還合。

「爾時，
"At that time,

時氣和適四時順節，
the climate will be harmonious, and the four seasons will follow their natural order,

人身之中無有百八之患：
and in human bodies, there will be no 108 afflictions:

貪欲、瞋恚、愚癡、不大慇懃。
greed, anger, ignorance, or negligence.

人心均平，皆同一意，
People's minds will be balanced, all sharing the same intent,

相見歡悅，善言相向。
meeting each other with joy and speaking kindly.

言辭一類無有差別，
Their words will be of one kind, with no differences,

如彼優單越人而無有異。
just like the Uttarakurus, with no variations.

是時，閻浮地內人民大小皆同一向，
At that time, in Jambudvīpa, all people, young and old, will be of one direction,

無若干之差別也。
with no significant differences.

彼時，男女之類意欲大小便時，
At that time, when men and women wish to relieve themselves,

地自然開，
the ground will naturally open,

事訖之後地便還合。」
and after the act, the ground will close again."

「爾時，閻浮地內自然生粳米，亦無皮裹，極為香美，食無患苦。所謂金、銀、珍寶、車𤦲、馬瑙、真珠、虎珀，各散在地，無人省錄。是時，人民手執此寶，自相謂言：『昔者之人由此寶故更相傷害，繫閉在獄受無數苦惱；如今此寶與瓦石同流，無人守護。』

「爾時，
"At that time,

閻浮地內自然生粳米，
in Jambudvīpa, naturally grown rice will appear,

亦無皮裹，
without any husks,

極為香美，食無患苦。
extremely fragrant and delicious, free from any sufferings when eaten.

所謂金、銀、珍寶、車𤦲、馬瑙、真珠、虎珀，
Gold, silver, jewels, wheel gems, agate, pearls, amber,

各散在地，無人省錄。
will be scattered on the ground, with no one taking notice.

是時，人民手執此寶，
At that time, people will hold these treasures in their hands,

自相謂言：
saying to each other:

『昔者之人由此寶故更相傷害，
'In the past, people harmed each other for these treasures,

繫閉在獄受無數苦惱；
resulting in imprisonment and countless sufferings;

如今此寶與瓦石同流，無人守護。』
but now these treasures are like common stones, with no one guarding them.'"

「爾時，法王出現，名曰蠰佉。正法治化，七寶成就。所謂七寶者，輪寶、象寶、馬寶、珠寶、玉女寶、典兵寶、守藏之寶，是謂七寶。鎮此閻浮地內，不以刀杖自然靡伏。如今，阿難！四珍之藏：乾陀越國伊羅鉢寶藏，多諸珍琦異物不可稱計；第二彌梯羅國綢羅大藏，亦多珍寶；第三須賴吒大國有大寶藏，亦多珍寶；第四婆羅㮈蠰佉有大寶藏，多諸珍寶不可稱計。此四大藏自然應現，諸守藏人各來白王：『唯願大王以此寶藏之物惠施貧窮。』爾時，蠰佉大王得此寶已，亦復不省錄之，意無財寶之想。時閻浮地內，自然樹上生衣，極細柔軟，人取著之，如今優單越人自然樹上生衣，而無有異。

「爾時，法王出現，名曰蠰佉。
"At that time, a Dharma King will appear, named Saṅkha.

正法治化，七寶成就。
He will govern with the true Dharma, accomplished with the seven treasures.

所謂七寶者，輪寶、象寶、馬寶、珠寶、玉女寶、典兵寶、守藏之寶，是謂七寶。
These seven treasures are: Wheel Treasure, Elephant Treasure, Horse Treasure, Jewel Treasure, Woman Treasure, General Treasure, and the Treasure of Storing, thus called the seven treasures.

鎮此閻浮地內，不以刀杖自然靡伏。
He will govern Jambudvīpa without using force, naturally subduing all.

如今，阿難！
Now, Ānanda!

四珍之藏：乾陀越國伊羅鉢寶藏，多諸珍琦異物不可稱計；
There are four great treasures: the Gandhāra country's Ilāpata Treasure, filled with countless precious and wondrous items;

第二彌梯羅國綢羅大藏，亦多珍寶；
the second, Mythila's Great Treasury, also filled with many treasures;

第三須賴吒大國有大寶藏，亦多珍寶；
the third, the Sūryaprabha Great Country's Great Treasury, also with many treasures;

第四婆羅㮈蠰佉有大寶藏，多諸珍寶不可稱計。
and the fourth, Bārāṇasī's Great Treasury of Saṅkha, containing innumerable treasures.

此四大藏自然應現，
These four great treasures will naturally appear,

諸守藏人各來白王：
and the guardians of these treasuries will come to the king, saying:

『唯願大王以此寶藏之物惠施貧窮。』
'We wish the Great King to use these treasures to bestow upon the poor.'

爾時，蠰佉大王得此寶已，
At that time, King Saṅkha, receiving these treasures,

亦復不省錄之，意無財寶之想。
will not even take note of them, having no thought of wealth.

時閻浮地內，自然樹上生衣，
At that time, in Jambudvīpa, clothes will naturally grow on trees,

極細柔軟，
extremely fine and soft,

人取著之，如今優單越人自然樹上生衣，而無有異。」
people will take and wear them, just as the clothes that grow naturally on trees in Uttarakuru, without any difference."

「爾時，彼王有大臣名曰修梵摩，是王少小同好，王甚愛敬；又且顏貌端正，不長、不短，不肥、不瘦，不白、不黑，不老、不少。是時，修梵摩有妻名梵摩越，王女中最極為殊妙，如天帝妃——口作優鉢蓮華香，身作栴檀香；諸婦人八十四態永無復有，亦無疾病亂想之念。

「爾時，彼王有大臣名曰修梵摩，
"At that time, that king will have a minister named Subrahmaṇa,

是王少小同好，王甚愛敬；
who shared interests with the king since youth, greatly loved and respected by the king.

又且顏貌端正，不長、不短，不肥、不瘦，不白、不黑，不老、不少。
Moreover, he will have a handsome appearance, neither too tall nor too short, neither too fat nor too thin, neither too white nor too dark, neither too old nor too young.

是時，修梵摩有妻名梵摩越，
At that time, Subrahmaṇa will have a wife named Brahmavatī,

王女中最極為殊妙，如天帝妃——口作優鉢蓮華香，身作栴檀香；
the most unique among the king's women, like a queen of the gods—her mouth will emit the scent of blue lotus, her body the fragrance of sandalwood;

諸婦人八十四態永無復有，亦無疾病亂想之念。」
among all women, she will have eighty-four marvelous forms, never to be seen again, free from illness and deluded thoughts."

「爾時，彌勒菩薩於兜率天，觀察父母不老不少，便降神下應從右脇生，如我今日右脇生無異，彌勒菩薩亦復如是。兜率諸天各各唱令：『彌勒菩薩已降神生。』

「爾時，
"At that time,

彌勒菩薩於兜率天，
Maitreya Bodhisattva, in the Tusita Heaven,

觀察父母不老不少，
observing his parents, neither old nor young,

便降神下應從右脇生，
will descend to be born from the right side,

如我今日右脇生無異，
just as I was born from the right side today,

彌勒菩薩亦復如是。
so too will Maitreya Bodhisattva.

兜率諸天各各唱令：
The gods of Tusita Heaven will each proclaim:

『彌勒菩薩已降神生。』
'Maitreya Bodhisattva has descended and been born.'"

「是時，修梵摩即與子立字，名曰彌勒。彌勒菩薩有三十二相、八十種好莊嚴其身，身黃金色。爾時，人壽極長，無有諸患，皆壽八萬四千歲。女人年五百歲然後出適。

「是時，
"At that time,

修梵摩即與子立字，
Subrahmaṇa will immediately name his son,

名曰彌勒。
calling him Maitreya.

彌勒菩薩有三十二相、八十種好莊嚴其身，
Maitreya Bodhisattva will have the thirty-two marks and eighty minor characteristics, adorning his body,

身黃金色。
with a golden complexion.

爾時，人壽極長，
At that time, human lifespan will be extremely long,

無有諸患，皆壽八萬四千歲。
without ailments, everyone living eighty-four thousand years.

女人年五百歲然後出適。」
Women will marry at the age of five hundred."

「爾時，彌勒在家未經幾時，便當出家學道。爾時，去翅頭城不遠有道樹名曰龍花，高一由旬，廣五百步。時彌勒菩薩坐彼樹下成無上道果。

「爾時，
"At that time,

彌勒在家未經幾時，
Maitreya, after not much time at home,

便當出家學道。
will set forth to renounce the household life and pursue the path.

爾時，去翅頭城不遠有道樹名曰龍花，
At that time, not far from Ketumati City, there will be a tree named Dragon Flower,

高一由旬，廣五百步。
one yojana tall and five hundred steps wide.

時彌勒菩薩坐彼樹下成無上道果。」
Maitreya Bodhisattva will sit beneath that tree and attain the incomparable fruit of enlightenment."

「當其夜半彌勒出家，即於其夜成無上道。時三千大千剎土六返震動，地神各各相告曰：『今時彌勒已成佛。』轉至聞四天王宮：『彌勒已成佛道。』轉轉聞徹三十三天、豔天、兜率天、化自在天、他化自在天，聲聞展轉至梵天：『彌勒已成佛道。』

「當其夜半彌勒出家，
"At midnight, Maitreya will renounce the household life,

即於其夜成無上道。
and on that very night, he will attain supreme enlightenment.

時三千大千剎土六返震動，
At that time, the three thousand great thousand worlds will shake six times,

地神各各相告曰：
and the earth deities will inform each other, saying:

『今時彌勒已成佛。』
'Now, Maitreya has become a Buddha.'

轉至聞四天王宮：
The message will then reach the Four Heavenly Kings' palaces:

『彌勒已成佛道。』
'Maitreya has attained Buddhahood.'

轉轉聞徹三十三天、豔天、兜率天、化自在天、他化自在天，
The news will continue to spread through the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, Yāma Heaven, Tusita Heaven, Nirmanarati Heaven, and Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven,

聲聞展轉至梵天：
eventually reaching the Brahma Heaven:

『彌勒已成佛道。』
'Maitreya has attained Buddhahood.'"

「爾時，魔王名大將，以法治化。聞如來名音響之聲，歡喜踊躍不能自勝，七日七夜不眠不寐。是時，魔王將欲界無數天人至彌勒佛所恭敬禮拜。

「爾時，
"At that time,

魔王名大將，以法治化。
there will be a māra king named Dàjiàng, who rules justly according to the Dharma.

聞如來名音響之聲，
Hearing the name and voice of the Tathāgata,

歡喜踊躍不能自勝，
he will be filled with joy and exultation, unable to control himself,

七日七夜不眠不寐。
remaining awake for seven days and nights.

是時，
This time,

魔王將欲界無數天人至彌勒佛所恭敬禮拜。」
the māra king, along with countless celestial beings from the desire realm, will come to Maitreya Buddha, respectfully paying homage."

「彌勒聖尊與諸天人漸漸說法微妙之論，所謂論者，施論、戒論、生天之論，欲不淨想、出要為妙。爾時，彌勒見諸人民已發心歡喜，諸佛世尊常所說法，苦、習、盡、道，盡與諸天人廣分別其義。爾時，座上八萬四千天子，諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。

「彌勒聖尊與諸天人漸漸說法微妙之論，所謂論者，施論、戒論、生天之論，欲不淨想、出要為妙。
Maitreya, the Holy One, gradually expounded subtle teachings to the devas and humans—discourses on giving, on morality, on heaven, on impurity of desires, on the sublime release.

爾時，彌勒見諸人民已發心歡喜，諸佛世尊常所說法，苦、習、盡、道，盡與諸天人廣分別其義。
Then, seeing the joy in the hearts of the people, Maitreya elucidated the teachings that all Buddhas expound: suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path, thoroughly explaining these to devas and humans.

爾時，座上八萬四千天子，諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。
At that time, 84,000 celestial beings on the seats had their defilements eliminated and attained the pure Dharma eye.

「爾時，大將魔王告彼界人民之類曰：『汝等速出家。所以然者？彌勒今日已度彼岸，亦當度汝等使至彼岸。』
Then, the māra king, Dàjiàng, addressed the people of that realm: 'Quickly renounce the household life. Why? This very day, Maitreya has crossed to the other shore and will likewise lead you across.'

「爾時，翅頭城中有長者名曰善財，聞魔王教令，又聞佛音響，將八萬四千眾至彌勒佛所，頭面禮足，在一面坐。
At that time, in Ketumati City, there was an elder named Sudatta. Hearing the māra king's command and the Buddha's voice, he led a group of 84,000 to Maitreya Buddha, bowed with his head at Buddha's feet, and sat to one side.

「爾時，彌勒漸與說法微妙之論，所謂論者，施論、戒論、生天之論，欲不淨想、出要為妙。爾時，彌勒見諸人民心開意解，如諸佛世尊常所說法，苦、習、盡、道，與諸人民廣分別義。爾時，座上八萬四千人諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。是時，善財與八萬四千人等即前白佛，求索出家，善修梵行，盡成阿羅漢道。

「爾時，彌勒漸與說法微妙之論，所謂論者，施論、戒論、生天之論，欲不淨想、出要為妙。
At that time, Maitreya gradually expounded subtle teachings—discourses on giving, morality, heaven, impurity of desires, and the sublime release.

爾時，彌勒見諸人民心開意解，如諸佛世尊常所說法，苦、習、盡、道，與諸人民廣分別義。
Seeing the people’s minds open and understanding arise, Maitreya explained the teachings as all Buddhas do: suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path, broadly clarifying these principles to the people.

爾時，座上八萬四千人諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。
At that time, 84,000 people on the seats had their defilements eliminated and attained the pure Dharma eye.

「爾時，彌勒初會，八萬四千人得阿羅漢。
At that time, Sudatta, along with 84,000 others, went before the Buddha, requesting to leave the household life. Practicing well the pure conduct, they all attained the path of Arhatship.

「是時，蠰佉王聞彌勒已成佛道，便往至佛所欲得聞法。時彌勒佛與王說法，初善、中善、竟善，義理深邃。爾時，大王復於異時立太子為王，賜剃頭師珍寶，復以雜寶與諸梵志，將八萬四千眾往至佛所求作沙門，盡成道果得阿羅漢。

「是時，蠰佉王聞彌勒已成佛道，便往至佛所欲得聞法。時彌勒佛與王說法，初善、中善、竟善，義理深邃。
At that time, King Saṅkha, hearing that Maitreya had attained Buddhahood, went to the Buddha desiring to hear the Dharma. Maitreya Buddha taught the Dharma to the king—excellent in the beginning, middle, and end, with profound meaning and principles.

爾時，大王復於異時立太子為王，賜剃頭師珍寶，復以雜寶與諸梵志，將八萬四千眾往至佛所求作沙門，盡成道果得阿羅漢。
Then, the great king, at another time, appointed the crown prince as king, bestowed treasures upon the barber, and gave various jewels to the Brāhmaṇas. He led a group of 84,000 to the Buddha, seeking to become śrāvakas, and all attained the fruit of the path, becoming Arhats.

「是時，修梵摩大長者聞彌勒已成佛道，將八萬四千梵志之眾往至佛所求作沙門，得阿羅漢——唯修梵摩一人斷三結使必盡苦際。
At that time, the elder Subrahmaṇa, hearing that Maitreya had attained Buddhahood, led 84,000 Brāhmaṇas to the Buddha, seeking to become śrāvakas. All attained Arhatship—only Subrahmaṇa alone severed the three fetters, destined to extinguish suffering completely.

「是時，佛母梵摩越復將八萬四千婇女之眾往至佛所求作沙門。爾時，諸女人盡得阿羅漢——唯有梵摩越一人斷三結使成須陀洹。
At that time, the Buddha's mother, Brahmavatī, brought a group of 84,000 maidens to the Buddha, seeking to become śrāvakas. All women attained Arhatship—only Brahmavatī alone severed the three fetters, becoming a stream-enterer (Sotāpanna).


「爾時，諸剎利婦聞彌勒如來出現世間成等正覺，數千萬眾往至佛所，頭面禮足，在一面坐，各各生心求作沙門，出家學道，或有越次取證、或有不取證者。
At that time, when the Kṣatriya women heard that the Tathāgata Maitreya had appeared in the world and attained perfect enlightenment, countless of them went to the Buddha, bowed with their heads at Buddha's feet, and sat to one side. Each gave rise to the intention to become śrāvakas, renouncing the household life, and pursuing the path, some attaining realizations out of sequence, while others did not attain any.

「爾時，阿難！其不越次取證者盡是奉法之人，患厭一切世間，修不可樂想。
"At that time, Ānanda, those who did not attain realizations out of sequence were all devoted to the Dharma, weary of the world, and cultivated the perception of impermanence and the suffering of worldly existence.

「爾時，彌勒當說三乘之教，如我今日。弟子之中大迦葉者行十二頭陀、過去諸佛所善修梵行，此人當佐彌勒勸化人民。」
"At that time, Maitreya will teach the Three Vehicles, just as I do today. Among his disciples, the great Kāśyapa, who practices the twelve dhūtaguṇas and has cultivated the pure conduct practiced by past Buddhas, will assist Maitreya in guiding the people."

爾時，迦葉去如來不遠結加趺坐，正身正意繫念在前。
At that time, Kāśyapa, not far from the Tathāgata, sat cross-legged, with his body upright and mind focused, maintaining mindfulness before him.

爾時，世尊告迦葉曰：「吾今年已衰耗向八十餘。然今如來有四大聲聞堪任遊化，智慧無盡，眾德具足。云何為四？所謂大迦葉比丘、屠鉢歎比丘、賓頭盧比丘、羅云比丘。汝等四大聲聞要不般涅槃，須吾法沒盡，然後乃當般涅槃。大迦葉亦不應般涅槃，要須彌勒出現世間。所以然者，彌勒所化弟子盡是釋迦文弟子，由我遺化得盡有漏。

爾時，世尊告迦葉曰：
At that time, the World-Honored One spoke to Kāśyapa:

「吾今年已衰耗向八十餘。
"I am now past eighty, aged and weak.

然今如來有四大聲聞堪任遊化，智慧無盡，眾德具足。
But among my disciples, there are four great śrāvakas, fit to travel and teach, with boundless wisdom and complete virtue.

云何為四？所謂大迦葉比丘、屠鉢歎比丘、賓頭盧比丘、羅云比丘。
Who are these four? They are the bhikṣus: Mahākāśyapa, Subhadda, Pindola Bhāradvāja, and Rāhula.

汝等四大聲聞要不般涅槃，須吾法沒盡，然後乃當般涅槃。
You four great śrāvakas must not enter parinirvāṇa before my teachings have completely vanished.

大迦葉亦不應般涅槃，要須彌勒出現世間。
Mahākāśyapa, you too should not enter parinirvāṇa until Maitreya appears in the world.

所以然者，彌勒所化弟子盡是釋迦文弟子，由我遺化得盡有漏。」
Why? Because Maitreya's disciples are all originally disciples of Śākyamuni, perfected through my remaining teachings and free of all defilements."

「摩竭國界毘提村中，大迦葉於彼山中住。又彌勒如來將無數千人眾，前後圍遶往至此山中，遂蒙佛恩，諸鬼神當與開門，使得見迦葉禪窟。是時，彌勒申右手指示迦葉，告諸人民：『過去久遠釋迦文佛弟子名曰迦葉，今日現在，頭陀苦行最為第一。』是時，諸人見是事已歎未曾有，無數百千眾生諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。或復有眾生見迦葉身已——此名為最初之會——九十六億人皆得阿羅漢，斯等之人皆是我弟子。所以然者？悉由受我訓之所致也，亦由四事因緣：惠施、仁愛、利人、等利。

「摩竭國界毘提村中，大迦葉於彼山中住。
"In the village of Videha in the Magadha realm, Mahākāśyapa resides in a mountain there.

又彌勒如來將無數千人眾，前後圍遶往至此山中，
Then, Maitreya Tathāgata, surrounded by countless beings, goes to this mountain,

遂蒙佛恩，諸鬼神當與開門，使得見迦葉禪窟。
and by the Buddha's grace, the spirits and deities will open the door, allowing them to see Kāśyapa's meditation cave.

是時，彌勒申右手指示迦葉，告諸人民：
At that time, Maitreya will extend his right hand to point at Kāśyapa, telling the people,

『過去久遠釋迦文佛弟子名曰迦葉，今日現在，頭陀苦行最為第一。』
'This is Kāśyapa, a disciple of Śākyamuni Buddha from long ago, who is now foremost in ascetic practices.'

是時，諸人見是事已歎未曾有，無數百千眾生諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。
At that time, the people will marvel at this unprecedented event, and innumerable beings will have their defilements eliminated and attain the pure Dharma eye.

或復有眾生見迦葉身已——此名為最初之會——九十六億人皆得阿羅漢，
Some beings, seeing Kāśyapa's body, at this first gathering, will have ninety-six hundred million attain Arhatship,

斯等之人皆是我弟子。所以然者？悉由受我訓之所致也，
and these people will all be my disciples. How so? It is because they have received my teachings.

亦由四事因緣：惠施、仁愛、利人、等利。」
This is due to four conditions: generosity, kindness, benefiting others, and equal benefit."

「爾時，阿難！彌勒如來當取迦葉僧伽梨著之。是時，迦葉身體奄然星散。是時，彌勒復取種種華香供養迦葉。所以然者？諸佛世尊有敬心於正法故。彌勒亦由我所受正法化，得成無上正真之道。

「爾時，阿難！彌勒如來當取迦葉僧伽梨著之。
"At that time, Ānanda, Maitreya Tathāgata will take Kāśyapa's robe and don it.

是時，迦葉身體奄然星散。
At that moment, Kāśyapa's body will dissolve into stardust.

是時，彌勒復取種種華香供養迦葉。
Then, Maitreya will offer various flowers and incense in homage to Kāśyapa.

所以然者？諸佛世尊有敬心於正法故。
Why? Because all Buddhas and World-Honored Ones revere the true Dharma.

彌勒亦由我所受正法化，得成無上正真之道。」
Maitreya, through receiving and practicing the true Dharma I have taught, has attained the supreme, perfectly true path."

「阿難當知，彌勒佛第二會時，有九十四億人，皆是阿羅漢，亦復是我遺教弟子，行四事供養之所致也。

「阿難當知，
"Ānanda, you should know,

彌勒佛第二會時，
that at Maitreya Buddha's second assembly,

有九十四億人，皆是阿羅漢，
ninety-four hundred million people will be Arhats,

亦復是我遺教弟子，
and they are also my disciples from the teachings I left behind,

行四事供養之所致也。」
attaining this through the practice of the four kinds of offerings."

「又彌勒第三之會，九十二億人皆是阿羅漢，亦復是我遺教弟子。

「又彌勒第三之會，
"Again, at Maitreya's third assembly,

九十二億人皆是阿羅漢，
ninety-two hundred million people will be Arhats,

亦復是我遺教弟子。」
and they are also my disciples from the teachings I left behind."

「爾時，比丘姓號皆名慈氏弟子，如我今日諸聲聞皆稱釋迦弟子。

「爾時，
"At that time,

比丘姓號皆名慈氏弟子，
all the monks will be known as disciples of Maitreya,

如我今日諸聲聞皆稱釋迦弟子。」
just as today all śrāvakas are called disciples of Śākyamuni."

「爾時，彌勒與諸弟子說法：『汝等比丘！當思惟無常之想、樂有苦想、計我無我想、實有空想、色變之想、青瘀之想、膖脹之想、食不消想、膿血想、一切世間不可樂想。所以然者？比丘當知，此十想者皆是過去釋迦文佛與汝等說，令得盡有漏、心得解脫。若此眾中釋迦文佛弟子，過去時修於梵行，來至我所；或復於釋迦文佛所供養三寶，來至我所；或於釋迦文佛所彈指之頃修於善本，來至此間；或於釋迦文佛所行四等心，來至此者；或於釋迦文佛所受持五戒、三自歸法，來至我所；或於釋迦文佛所起神寺廟，來至我所；或於釋迦文佛所補治故寺，來至我所；或於釋迦文佛所受八關齋法，來至我所；或於釋迦文佛所香華供養，來至此者；或復於彼聞法悲泣墮淚，來至我所；或復於釋迦文佛所專意聽受法，來至我所；或復盡形壽善修梵行，來至我所；或復有書寫讀誦，來至我所；或復承事供養，來至我所者。』

「爾時，
"At that time,

彌勒與諸弟子說法：
Maitreya will teach the Dharma to his disciples:

『汝等比丘！
'You bhikṣus!

當思惟無常之想、樂有苦想、計我無我想、
Contemplate the impermanence of all things, the suffering inherent in pleasure, the absence of a self in what is falsely deemed "self,"

實有空想、色變之想、青瘀之想、
the actuality of emptiness, the transformation of form, the bruising of the body,

膖脹之想、食不消想、膿血想、
the swelling of corpses, undigested food, pus and blood,

一切世間不可樂想。
and the perception of the world's inherent unsatisfactoriness.

所以然者？
Why?

比丘當知，此十想者皆是過去釋迦文佛與汝等說，
Because, bhikṣus, these ten contemplations were taught to you by Śākyamuni Buddha in the past,

令得盡有漏、心得解脫。
enabling you to extinguish defilements and attain liberation.

若此眾中釋迦文佛弟子，過去時修於梵行，來至我所；
If among this assembly, there are disciples of Śākyamuni Buddha who practiced pure conduct in the past, they have come to me;

或復於釋迦文佛所供養三寶，來至我所；
or those who paid homage to the Three Jewels in Śākyamuni Buddha's time, they have come to me;

或於釋迦文佛所彈指之頃修於善本，來至此間；
or those who, with just a snap of the fingers, cultivated merit under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come here;

或於釋迦文佛所行四等心，來至此者；
or those who practiced the four immeasurable minds under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come here;

或於釋迦文佛所受持五戒、三自歸法，來至我所；
or those who upheld the five precepts and the Three Refuges under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或於釋迦文佛所起神寺廟，來至我所；
or those who established temples and shrines under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或於釋迦文佛所補治故寺，來至我所；
or those who restored old temples under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或於釋迦文佛所受八關齋法，來至我所；
or those who observed the eight precepts under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或於釋迦文佛所香華供養，來至此者；
or those who offered incense and flowers under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come here;

或復於彼聞法悲泣墮淚，來至我所；
or those who heard the Dharma and shed tears under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或復於釋迦文佛所專意聽受法，來至我所；
or those who diligently listened to the Dharma under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或復盡形壽善修梵行，來至我所；
or those who practiced pure conduct throughout their lives under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或復有書寫讀誦，來至我所；
or those who wrote, read, and recited scriptures under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me;

或復承事供養，來至我所者。』
or those who served and made offerings under Śākyamuni Buddha, they have come to me.'"

「是時，彌勒便說此偈：
"At that time, Maitreya will then recite this verse:

「『增益戒聞德，　　禪及思惟業，
善修於梵行，　　而來至我所。
勸施發歡心，　　修行心原本，
意無若干想，　　皆來至我所。
或發平等心，　　承事於諸佛，
飯飴於聖眾，　　皆來至我所。
或誦戒契經，　　善習與人說，
熾然於法本，　　今來至我所。
釋種善能化，　　供養諸舍利，
承事法供養，　　今來至我所。
若有書寫經，　　班宣於素上，
其有供養經，　　皆來至我所。
繒綵及諸物，　　供養於神寺，
自稱南無佛，　　皆來至我所。
供養於現在、　　諸佛過去者，
禪定正平等，　　亦無有增減。
是故於佛法，　　承事於聖眾，
專心事三寶，　　必至無為處。』

「『增益戒聞德，　　禪及思惟業，
“Enhance virtue through precepts and hearing,
practice meditation and contemplation,

善修於梵行，　　而來至我所。
well practice pure conduct,
and come to me.

勸施發歡心，　　修行心原本，
Encourage giving with joyful heart,
cultivate the roots of practice,

意無若干想，　　皆來至我所。
with pure thoughts unfettered,
all come to me.

或發平等心，　　承事於諸佛，
Some develop equal mind,
serve the Buddhas,

飯飴於聖眾，　　皆來至我所。
offer nourishment to the noble assembly,
all come to me.

或誦戒契經，　　善習與人說，
Some recite precepts and sūtras,
skillfully explain to others,

熾然於法本，　　今來至我所。
ardent in the roots of Dharma,
now come to me.

釋種善能化，　　供養諸舍利，
The Śākya clan skillfully transform,
offering relics,

承事法供養，　　今來至我所。
serve and make offerings to the Dharma,
now come to me.

若有書寫經，　　班宣於素上，
Those who write scriptures,
spreading them on plain leaves,

其有供養經，　　皆來至我所。
those who make offerings to sūtras,
all come to me.

繒綵及諸物，　　供養於神寺，
Fine cloth and various items,
offer to the sacred temple,

自稱南無佛，　　皆來至我所。
those who say ‘Namo Buddha,’
all come to me.

供養於現在、　　諸佛過去者，
Those who offer to present and past Buddhas,

禪定正平等，　　亦無有增減。
in meditation, proper and equal,
with no increase or reduction.

是故於佛法，　　承事於聖眾，
Therefore, in the Buddha’s Dharma,
serve the noble assembly,

專心事三寶，　　必至無為處。』」
with focused mind, serve the Triple Gem,
surely reach the place of non-action.”

「阿難當知，彌勒如來在彼眾中當說此偈。爾時，彼眾中諸天人民思惟此十想，十一姟人諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。彌勒如來千歲之中，眾僧無有瑕穢。爾時，恒以一偈以為禁戒：

「阿難當知，
"Ānanda, you should know,

彌勒如來在彼眾中當說此偈。
that Maitreya Tathāgata will recite this verse among the assembly.

爾時，彼眾中諸天人民思惟此十想，
At that time, the devas and humans in the assembly will contemplate these ten perceptions,

十一姟人諸塵垢盡，得法眼淨。
and within the eleven ranks of people, the defilements will be eliminated, and they will attain the pure Dharma eye.

彌勒如來千歲之中，
Throughout Maitreya Tathāgata's thousand-year life span,

眾僧無有瑕穢。
the assembly of monks will be free from faults and impurities.

爾時，恒以一偈以為禁戒：
At that time, one verse will constantly serve as the precept:

「『口、意不行惡，　　身亦無所犯，
當除此三行，　　速脫生死關。』

「『口、意不行惡，　　身亦無所犯，
'By mouth and mind, commit no evil;
let the body be without fault.

當除此三行，　　速脫生死關。』
Eliminate these three actions,
swiftly exit the bonds of birth and death.'"

「過千歲後，當有犯戒之人，遂復立戒。

「過千歲後，
"After a thousand years,

當有犯戒之人，
there will be people who break the precepts,

遂復立戒。」
and thus the precepts will be reestablished."

「彌勒如來當壽八萬四千歲。般涅槃後，遺法當在八萬四千歲。所以然者，爾時眾生皆是利根。

「彌勒如來當壽八萬四千歲。
"Maitreya Tathāgata will have a lifespan of 84,000 years.

般涅槃後，遺法當在八萬四千歲。
After his parinirvāṇa, his teachings will remain for 84,000 years.

所以然者，爾時眾生皆是利根。」
Why? Because at that time, all beings will possess sharp faculties."

「其有善男子、善女人欲得見彌勒佛及三會聲聞眾及翅頭城及見蠰佉王并四大藏珍寶者、欲食自然粳米者、并著自然衣裳、身壞命終生天上者，彼善男子、善女人當勤加精進，無生懈怠；亦當供養承事諸法師，名花㨶香種種供養，無令有失。如是，阿難！當作是學。」

「其有善男子、善女人欲得見彌勒佛及三會聲聞眾及翅頭城及見蠰佉王并四大藏珍寶者、
"Any virtuous men or women who wish to see Maitreya Buddha, the assembly of śrāvakas at the three assemblies, Ketumati City, King Saṅkha, and the four great treasuries of precious jewels,

欲食自然粳米者、并著自然衣裳、身壞命終生天上者，
or wish to eat naturally grown rice, wear naturally produced garments, and be reborn in the heavens at the end of their lives,

彼善男子、善女人當勤加精進，無生懈怠；
such virtuous men and women should practice diligently, without sloth.

亦當供養承事諸法師，名花㨶香種種供養，無令有失。
They should also make offerings and serve the Dharma teachers, offering various fragrant flowers and incense, without fail.

如是，阿難！當作是學。」
Thus, Ānanda! You should learn this way."

爾時，阿難及諸大會，聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。

爾時，阿難及諸大會，
At that time, Ānanda and the entire great assembly,

聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。
hearing the Buddha's words, joyfully accepted and practiced them.

佛說彌勒下生經
The Sutra of the Buddha's Discourse on Maitreya's Descent

按《開元錄》有譯無本中有法護譯《彌勒成佛經》，一名「彌勒當來下生經」者。乍觀此經即彼失本而還得之，其實非也。何則？羅什譯《彌勒成佛經》目下注云：「與《下生經》異本，與法護譯《彌勒成佛經》同本。」兩譯一闕，則彼失本經，非此《下生經》六譯三失之一者明矣。又按孤山智圓重校金剛般若後序云：「古德分經皆用紙數者，一紙有二十五行，一行十七字。今撿失本彌勒經目下注云：『一十七紙』，則計有七千二百二十二字，此經只有三千一百七十六字，則尚未其半，豈是彼經歟？」則丹藏無此經為得。然此經文頗似漢晉，經注又有漢云之言，還恐此是三失本中第一本。錄云今附西晉者耳，宋藏還得而編入之為得之矣。而二錄並無《下生經》是法護譯者，今云法護譯者何耶？伏俟賢哲。

按《開元錄》有譯無本中有法護譯《彌勒成佛經》，一名「彌勒當來下生經」者。
According to the "Kaiyuan Record," there is a translation without the original text by Dharmarakṣa titled "Maitreya's Attainment of Buddhahood Sutra," also known as "Maitreya's Future Descent Sutra."

乍觀此經即彼失本而還得之，其實非也。
At first glance, this sutra appears to be the long-lost original recovered, but it is not so.

何則？
Why?

羅什譯《彌勒成佛經》目下注云：「與《下生經》異本，與法護譯《彌勒成佛經》同本。」
In Kumārajīva's translation of the "Maitreya's Attainment of Buddhahood Sutra," a note states: "It is a different version from the 'Descent Sutra,' yet the same as Dharmarakṣa's translation of 'Maitreya's Attainment of Buddhahood Sutra.'"

兩譯一闕，則彼失本經，非此《下生經》六譯三失之一者明矣。
With these two translations missing one part, it is clear that the lost sutra is not one of the six translations of the "Descent Sutra" that has three missing versions.

又按孤山智圓重校金剛般若後序云：
Additionally, according to the postface by Zhi Yuan of Gushan in his re-editing of the "Diamond Prajñā":

「古德分經皆用紙數者，一紙有二十五行，一行十七字。
"Ancient masters divided sutras by the number of sheets, with each sheet containing twenty-five lines, and each line having seventeen characters.

今撿失本彌勒經目下注云：『一十七紙』，
Now, checking the lost Maitreya Sutra, the note states: 'Seventeen sheets,'

則計有七千二百二十二字，
which calculates to 7,222 characters.

此經只有三千一百七十六字，
This sutra contains only 3,176 characters,

則尚未其半，豈是彼經歟？」
which is less than half; how can it be that sutra?"

則丹藏無此經為得。
Therefore, the Dan-cang does not contain this sutra as obtained.

然此經文頗似漢晉，經注又有漢云之言，
However, this sutra's text closely resembles that of the Han-Jin period, with annotations stating "Han said."

還恐此是三失本中第一本。
It is suspected that this is the first among the three lost versions.

錄云今附西晉者耳，
The record states it is now attached to the Western Jin.

宋藏還得而編入之為得之矣。
The Song collection also obtained and included it.

而二錄並無《下生經》是法護譯者，
However, the two records do not list the "Descent Sutra" as translated by Dharmarakṣa.

今云法護譯者何耶？
How is it now claimed to be translated by Dharmarakṣa?

伏俟賢哲。
We await the judgment of the wise and learned.
