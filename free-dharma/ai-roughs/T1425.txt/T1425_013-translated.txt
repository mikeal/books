在绿树浓荫下，我独自漫步。
Beneath the dense shade of green trees, I stroll alone.

清风徐来，吹拂我的脸庞。
A gentle breeze comes, brushing against my face.

阳光穿透树叶，洒下点点光斑。
Sunlight pierces through the leaves, scattering specks of light.

在这个宁静的下午，我感到无比宁和。
In this tranquil afternoon, I feel incredibly peaceful.

明單提九十二事之二
The second of the ninety-two issues mentioned in the Ming list




佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, expounding extensively as above.

時城中有大富婬女家，多饒財寶種種成就，庫藏盈溢守備牢固，外賊伺求無能得者。
At that time, there was a wealthy courtesan's house in the city, rich with various treasures and accomplishments, with its storerooms overflowing and well-guarded, making outsiders unable to steal anything.

時有一賊主，善作方便，遣使語婬女言：「我等欲詣某池上，多請婬女設種種飲食，自恣娛樂。
There was a chief of thieves, skilled in scheming, who sent a messenger to the courtesan saying, "We wish to go to such-and-such a pond and invite the courtesan to offer various foods and entertain at her leisure.

汝便可好自莊嚴詣彼池上，勿令不好，為彼所嗤。」
You can go there well-adorned, do not be poorly dressed, so as not to be mocked by them."

女人之心以妬勝為先，名衣上服珠璣瓔珞，盡以嚴身，種種莊飾光焰曜目，往赴彼請。
The woman's heart, led by jealousy, adorned herself with jewels and fine ornaments, dressed her best, and went to the invitation, dazzling everyone's eyes with her radiance.

時此賊主方便誘導，將詣避隱深邃之處，婬女問言：「向請諸女今何所在？」
Then the thief chief cunningly guided her to a hidden secluded place, and the courtesan asked, "Where are the other women you invited?"

答言：「須臾當至，且作歡樂。」
He replied, "They will arrive shortly; for now, let's enjoy ourselves."

彼時婬女便作是念：「今觀此人是賊無疑。何以知之？此非本期處；又諸女悉皆不來。」
At that moment, the courtesan thought, "I have no doubt that this man is a thief. How do I know? This is not the intended place; also, the other women didn’t come."

日遂向暮，婬女便言：「我欲還家。」
As night approached, the courtesan said, "I wish to return home."

賊主報言：「且相娛樂，何乃怱怱？」
The thief chief replied, "Let's enjoy ourselves a little longer; why are you in such a hurry?"

時女思惟：「此定作賊，必為彼所困。我有妙術六十四種，今正是時。若不用者，何以免濟？」
The woman thought, "He is surely a thief, intending to harm me. I have sixty-four wonderful tricks; now is the time. If I don't use them, how will I escape?"

爾時此女偽現姿媚愛相，與賊交杯，似自飲酒，勸賊令盡。
At this moment, the woman feigned seductive affection, drank with the thief, pretending to drink herself while urging the thief to drink more.

外現慇懃，妖媚親附，內心與隔，使彼賊心耽惑悅樂，不復有疑。
She outwardly showed sincerity, charm, and intimacy, while inwardly keeping distance, making the thief engrossed in pleasure without any suspicion.

時賊主獨將婬女至一屏處，酒勢遂發，醉無所覺。
The thief chief brought the courtesan alone to a secluded spot, and the effects of the alcohol took over, making him unaware.

此女徐自歛身離賊，收襆嚴飾，向舍衛城。
The woman quietly collected herself away from the thief, gathered her decorations, and headed to the city of Shravasti.

城門已閉，迴向祇洹，寺門亦閉。
The city gates were closed, and she turned towards Jetavana but found the monastery gates closed as well.

爾時門外有一長老比丘，字迦盧，去門不遠，在一屏處，敷繩床而坐，衣四垂下。
At that time, outside the gate, there was an elderly monk named Kalur, sitting not far away in a secluded spot on a rope bed, with his robe hanging down.

此婬女於恐怖中來趣安隱處，即入長老床下。
In her fear, the courtesan approached this safe place and hid under the elder’s bed.

迦盧爾時入三昧，不察床下。
At that time, Kalur was absorbed in meditation and did not notice under the bed.

賊夜半後醉醒，欲剝婬女，覓而不見。
The thief, waking from drunkenness after midnight, wanted to find and rob the courtesan but could not see her.

賊帥問諸伴言：「汝等見此女人不？」
The thief chief asked his companions, "Did you see this woman?"

皆言：「不見。」
They all said, "No, we did not."

各各把火求覓，都不知處，復相謂言：「若如是不得者，當求脚跡。」
They each took a torch to search, not knowing where to look, and further said to each other, "If we can't find her like this, we should trace her footprints."

即尋跡到舍衛城門。
They traced her footprints to the gates of Shravasti.

門閉復尋跡遂至祇洹門下，便失其跡不知所向。
Finding the gates closed, they traced the footprints to the entrance of Jetavana but lost the trail, not knowing where it went.

賊雖見是比丘，無有疑心。
Although the thief saw that it was a monk, he had no suspicion.

爾時天遂向曉，舍衛城中已打明鼓，復聞象馬雞狗之聲。
At that time, dawn approached, and in the city of Shravasti, drums were sounded, and the sounds of elephants, horses, roosters, and dogs could be heard.

爾時賊帥便相謂言：「今失此女，不知所在。天復欲曉，不宜久停，當還林中避隱之處。」
The thief chief then said to his companions, "We have lost this woman and don't know where she is. Dawn is approaching, so it is not wise to linger; we should return to a hiding place in the forest."

作是念已，即還林中。
With this thought, they returned to the forest.

天曉，城中人民象馬車乘出城，又諸優婆塞亦皆出城，禮覲世尊已，過禮迦盧比丘，見此婬女於床下而出，眾人見已皆譏嫌言：
At dawn, the people of the city and their elephant and horse-drawn carriages exited the city. Laypeople also left the city, paid respects to the Blessed One, and passing by, they bowed to Kalur Bhikkhu, and upon seeing the courtesan emerge from under his bed, they all mocked and complained, saying:

「此阿練若，云何納衣乞食，通夜與婬女從事，曉乃放去？失沙門法。何道之有？」
"This forest-dwelling monk, how can he wear robes and beg for food while spending the night with a courtesan, releasing her only at dawn? He has lost the way of the monk. What path does he follow?"

爾時長老陀驃摩羅子迦盧比丘醜名流布。
At that time, the elder Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu's disgraceful name spread widely.

諸比丘聞已，具白世尊，佛言：「比丘！是陀驃迦盧比丘，非梵行惡名流布。
The monks, having heard this, reported it to the Blessed One, who said, "Monks! As for Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu, his lack of chastity has led to a bad reputation.

汝等當於屏處三問、多人中三問、僧中三問。」
You should ask him three questions in a secluded place, three questions in a group, and three questions among the Sangha."

屏處問者，應作是問：「長老陀驃迦盧！諸梵行人作是語，是事知不？」
In the secluded place, you should ask, "Elder Tapussa's son Kalur! The people claim this about you; do you know about this?

答言：「不知作、不憶作。」如是第二、第三，多人中三問、眾僧中三問，亦如是。
He should answer, 'I do not know of it, nor do I remember doing it.' Do the same for the second and third questions, both in the group and among the Sangha."

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！是陀驃迦盧比丘已於屏處三問、多人中三問、眾僧中三問，自言不知作、不憶作。」
The monks reported to the Blessed One, "Sire! We have asked Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu the three questions in private, in a group, and among the Sangha, and he claims not to know or remember doing it."

佛告諸比丘：「是陀驃迦盧比丘清淨無罪，僧應與憶念毘尼滅，清淨共住。」
The Buddha told the monks, "Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu is pure and without fault, and the Sangha should give him the benefits of the Pratimoksha and live together in purity."

作求聽羯磨，羯磨者應作是說：「大德僧聽！
Conduct a motion (Karma); the motion should be stated thus: "Venerable Sangha, please listen!

是長老陀驃迦盧！諸梵行人作是語，自言不知作、不憶作。
This concerns Elder Tapussa's son Kalur! The people practicing chastity are saying this, and he claims not to know or remember doing it.

若僧時到，僧長老陀驃迦盧，欲從僧乞憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。
If it is time for the Sangha to congregate, Elder Tapussa's son Kalur wishes to request the Sangha for memory and extinction, to dwell in purity.

諸大德聽！是陀驃迦盧比丘欲從僧乞憶念毘尼滅，清淨住，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
Venerables, please listen! This is Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu wishing to request the Sangha for memory and extinction, to dwell in purity. This silence indicates approval."

乞法者，是陀驃迦盧比丘，偏袒右肩、脫革屣、右膝著地，作是言：
For the request, Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu should bare his right shoulder, remove his sandals, kneel with his right knee on the ground, and say:

「我陀驃迦盧比丘，諸梵行人作是語，我不知作、不憶作。
"I, Tapussa's son Kalur Bhikkhu, the people practicing chastity say this about me, but I do not know or remember doing it.

我陀驃迦盧今從僧乞憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。唯願僧與我憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。」
Now, I request the Sangha for memory and extinction, to dwell in purity. May the Sangha grant me memory and extinction, to dwell in purity."

如是第二、第三乞。
Do likewise for the second and third requests.

羯磨人當作是說：「大德僧聽！長老陀驃迦盧，諸梵行人作是語，自言不知作、不憶作。
For the motion, the announcement should be: "Venerable Sangha, please listen! Elder Tapussa's son Kalur states that he does not know or remember doing what people say.

已從僧乞憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。
He has requested the Sangha for memory and extinction, to dwell in purity.

若僧時到，僧與長老陀驃迦盧憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。白如是。」
If the appropriate time arrives, the Sangha should grant Elder Tapussa's son Kalur memory and extinction, to dwell in purity. It is declared thus."

「大德僧聽！是長老陀驃迦盧，諸梵行人作是語，自言不知作、不憶作。
"Venerable Sangha, listen! This concerns Elder Tapussa's son Kalur. The people of the spiritual path are saying this, and he states he does not know or remember doing it.

已從僧乞憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。
He has requested the Sangha for memory and extinction, to dwell in purity.

僧今與長老陀驃迦盧憶念毘尼滅，清淨住。諸大德忍與長老陀驃迦盧憶念毘尼滅清淨住者默然，若不忍便說。
Now, the Sangha grants Elder Tapussa's son Kalur memory and extinction, to dwell in purity. Those in favor, please remain silent; if opposed, please speak.

是初羯磨。」
This is the initial motion."

如是第二、第三說。
Likewise, proceed with the second and third motions.

「僧已與長老陀驃迦盧憶念毘尼滅清淨住竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
"The Sangha has now granted Elder Tapussa's son Kalur memory and extinction, to dwell in purity, and since the Sangha is silently agreed, this stands as is."



：「已與陀驃迦盧憶念毘尼未？」

The Buddha asked the monks, "Have you imparted the Vinaya memory to Dhaniyan?"

答言：「已與。」

They replied, "Yes, we have."

佛言：「比丘五法成就非法與憶念毘尼。何等五？

The Buddha said, "There are five wrong ways to impart the Vinaya memory to the monks. What are the five?

不清淨清淨想與、清淨不清淨想與、不先檢校、非法、不和合，

Impure things are mistaken for pure, pure things are mistaken for impure, not checking beforehand, unlawfulness, and disunity.

是名五非法與憶念毘尼。

These are called the five wrong ways to impart the Vinaya memory.

五如法與憶念毘尼。何等五？

There are five correct ways to impart the Vinaya memory. What are the five?

清淨清淨想與、不清淨不清淨想與、先檢校、如法、和合，

Pure things are recognized as pure, impure things are recognized as impure, checking beforehand, according to law, and unity.

是名五如法與憶念毘尼。」

These are called the five correct ways to impart the Vinaya memory."

時諸比丘白佛言：「云何，世尊！是婬女人為賊所逐？」

Then the monks said to the Buddha, "Why, World-Honored One, does the wanton woman get chased by robbers?"

佛言：「不但今日為賊所逐，過去世時以曾為彼所逐，

The Buddha said, "Not only today is she chased by robbers, she was also chased by them in past lives,

如《怨家本生經》中廣說。」

as is extensively stated in the 'Jataka of the Hostile Clan.'"



爾時尊者阿難往至佛所，頭面禮足，却住一面，白佛言：「世尊！云何名為憶念毘尼？」

At that time, Venerable Ananda went to the Buddha, bowed at his feet, stepped aside to stand, and said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, how is the Vinaya of recollection defined?"

佛語阿難：「若比丘謗比丘，若波羅夷、僧伽婆尸沙、波夜提、波羅提提舍尼、越毘尼，當疾集僧。

The Buddha said to Ananda, "If a monk slanders a monk, for offenses such as Parajika, Sanghabheda, Sanghadisesa, Pacittiya, or Pratidesaniya, the assembly should be quickly gathered.

疾集僧已，問是比丘和上、阿闍梨、同友知識，作是言：『長老！汝知某比丘先來為人，戒行何似？與誰為知識？彼知識為善惡？』

Once the assembly is gathered, ask the superior, preceptor, and fellow acquaintances of that monk, saying, 'Elder! Do you know what manner of person that monk used to be in terms of observing precepts? Who is his acquaintance? Are those acquaintances good or bad?'

若言：『某甲先來持戒行清淨，與善知識同友犯小小罪，心懷慚愧速疾除悔。』如是人僧應與憶念毘尼。

If they say, 'So-and-so used to observe the precepts purely, associated with good acquaintances, and when committing small offenses, he feels ashamed and quickly repents.' The assembly should perform the act of recollection for such a person.

若言：『我知彼比丘先來戒行不清淨，又與惡知識從事，犯罪不能如法悔過。』

If they say, 'I know that monk did not previously observe the precepts purely, and associated with bad acquaintances, unable to properly repent when committing offenses.'

阿難！如是比丘僧不應與憶念毘尼滅。

Ananda! The assembly should not perform the recollection act for such a monk.

如是阿難！如法如律與憶念毘尼滅誹謗諍已，

Thus, Ananda! According to the Dharma and Vinaya, when the recollection act has been performed, slander and disputes are resolved,

若客比丘、若去比丘、若與欲比丘、若見不欲比丘、若在坐睡比丘、

whether the monk is a guest, departing, agreeable, non-agreeable, or sitting and sleeping,

新受戒比丘，是諸比丘言：

or a newly ordained monk, these monks say:

『作如是羯磨不成就、不如法、愚癡無智，別佛別法別僧，

'To perform such an act is unachieved, contrary to the Dharma, foolish, unintelligent, separate from Buddha, separate from Dharma, separate from Sangha,

猶如牛羊不善羯磨不成就。』

like cattle or sheep, unskilled in acts, and unaccomplished.'

作如是更發起者，波夜提罪，是名誹謗諍憶念毘尼滅。」

If someone raises such objections again, it is a Pacittiya offense; this resolves the slander and disputes under the Vinaya of recollection."

云何誹謗諍不癡比尼滅？

How does one resolve slander and disputes wisely under this Vinaya?



住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti and taught extensively as above.

尊者劫賓那有二共行弟子：一名難提，二名鉢遮難提。
The Venerable Kapinna had two disciples who traveled with him: one named Nandi, the other named Bhadranandi.

是二比丘本狂癡病，病時作種種非法；
These two monks were formerly afflicted with madness, and while ill, they committed various unwholesome acts.

今已差，諸梵行人猶故說其癡狂時所作。
They have since recovered, but the sages still speak of their deeds done during their madness.

是二比丘聞是語時，用為羞愧。
When these two monks heard such words, they were ashamed.

以是因緣，語諸比丘。
For this reason, they spoke to the other monks.

諸比丘以是事具白世尊，
The monks reported this matter in full to the World-Honored One.

佛言：「是難提、鉢遮難提本癡狂，病時作種種非法；
The Buddha said, "These two, Nandi and Bhadranandi, were originally mad and committed various unwholesome acts while ill.

今癡已差，諸梵行人猶故說其本癡狂時所作。」
Now their madness has been healed, but the sages still speak of their original mad deeds."

佛告諸比丘：「汝等當於屏處三問、多人中三問、僧中三問。」
The Buddha told the monks, "You should ask them three questions in private, three questions among many people, and three questions among the assembly.

屏處問者，應作是言：「長老！諸梵行人作是語，汝知不？」
When asking privately, you should say, "Elder! The sages say this, do you know?"

答言：「不知作、不憶作。」
Reply, "I do not know or remember doing it."

如是第二、第三，多人中三問，眾僧中三問，亦如是。
This should be done a second and third time; the three questions among many people and among the assembly should also be asked similarly.

諸比丘以是事往白世尊：「已屏處三問、多人中三問、眾僧中三問，
The monks took this matter to the World-Honored One, saying, "We have asked three questions in private, among many people, and among the assembly.

自言不知作、不憶作。」
They themselves said they do not know or remember doing it."

佛告諸比丘：「是二比丘本癡、今不癡，
The Buddha told the monks, "These two were originally mad, now they are not mad.

諸梵行人說前癡時所行，自言不知作、不憶作。
The sages speak of acts they did when mad, but they themselves say they do not know or remember doing it.

僧應與作不癡毘尼滅。」
The assembly should grant them pardon through the non-mad Vinaya."

作法者應作求聽羯磨，唱言：
For the procedure, one should make a request for communal karma, announcing:

「大德僧聽！是長老難提、鉢遮難提，本癡、今不癡，
"Honored Sangha, listen! Elder Nandi and Bhadranandi were originally mad, now they are not mad.

諸梵行人說前癡行，自言不知作、不憶作。
The sages speak of their former mad acts, they themselves say they do not know or remember doing it.

若僧時到，僧是難提、鉢遮難提比丘，欲從僧乞不癡毘尼滅。
If the Sangha is timely, they, the monks Nandi and Bhadranandi, wish to ask the Sangha for pardon through the non-mad Vinaya.

諸大德聽！是難提鉢遮難提欲從僧乞不癡毘尼滅，
Honored ones, listen! Nandi and Bhadranandi wish to ask the Sangha for pardon through the non-mad Vinaya.

僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
With the Sangha's consent in silence, let it be thus maintained."

乞法者，是難提、鉢遮難提，偏袒右肩、胡跪合掌，
The petitioner, Nandi and Bhadranandi, should bare their right shoulder, kneel on one knee with joined palms,

作是言：「我某甲本癡、今不癡，
and say, "I, so-and-so, was originally mad, now I am not mad.

諸梵行人說前癡行，我不知作、不憶作，
The sages speak of my former mad acts, I do not know or remember doing them.

今從僧乞不癡毘尼滅，唯願僧與我不癡毘尼滅。」
Now I seek pardon from the Sangha through the non-mad Vinaya, and only wish the Sangha grants me this non-mad Vinaya pardon."

如是第二、第三乞。
This should be requested a second and third time.

僧應語彼比丘言：「僧無有說汝事者。
The Sangha should tell the monk, "No member of the Sangha speaks of your deeds.

說汝事者，汝當往語，使勿復說。」
If someone speaks of your deeds, you should go and tell them not to speak of it again."

此比丘應往彼比丘所言：
The monk should go to the one who speaks of it and say:

「長老！我先狂癡時所作，我今不知作、不憶作，
"Elder! What I did when formerly mad, I do not know or remember doing now,

願長老勿復說我癡時所作。」
Please, elder, do not speak again of what I did when mad."

彼比丘若止善，若不止應語彼和上、阿闍梨及同友知識，
If the monk ceases, that is good. If not, one should speak to their preceptor, teacher, and fellow practitioners,

作是言：「長老！汝弟子若同友知識，
saying, "Elder! Your disciple, or fellow practitioner,

說我本癡時所作，我不知作、不憶作，
is speaking of what I did when originally mad, which I do not know or remember,

願長老為我呵語彼勿復更說。」
I would like for the elder to admonish them on my behalf so they do not speak of it further."

彼和尚阿闍梨應當呵語：
The preceptor and teacher should admonish,

「汝不善，不知戒相，不聞世尊說癡狂、心亂作無罪耶？」
saying, "You are not virtuous, do you not know the precepts? Have you not heard the World-Honored One say that madness and mental confusion are not offenses?"

彼說事人若受者善。
If the person speaking of the matter accepts this, it is good.

爾時僧應作羯磨，羯磨人如是唱：
At that time, the Sangha should perform a communal action, and the proctor should proclaim:

「大德僧聽！長老難提、鉢遮難提，本癡、今不癡，
"Honored Sangha, listen! Elder Nandi and Bhadranandi were originally mad, now they are not mad.

諸梵行人說前癡行，自言不知作、不憶作。
The sages speak of their former mad acts, they themselves say they do not know or remember doing it.

已從僧乞不癡毘尼滅。
They have already asked the Sangha for pardon through the non-mad Vinaya.

若僧時到，僧與難提、鉢遮難提作不癡毘尼滅。
If the Sangha agrees, the Sangha grants Nandi and Bhadranandi the non-mad Vinaya pardon.

白如是。」
Thus I declare."

「大德僧聽！是難提、鉢遮難提，本癡、今不癡，
"Honored Sangha, listen! Nandi and Bhadranandi were originally mad, now they are not mad.

諸梵行人說前癡行，自言不知作、不憶作。
The sages speak of their former mad acts, they themselves say they do not know or remember doing it.

已從僧乞不癡毘尼滅。
They have asked the Sangha for pardon through the non-mad Vinaya.

僧今與某甲作不癡毘尼滅。
The Sangha now grants so-and-so the non-mad Vinaya pardon.

諸大德忍與難提、鉢遮難提不癡毘尼滅忍者默然，若不忍便說。
Those who agree with granting Nandi and Bhadranandi the non-mad Vinaya pardon, remain silent; if not, speak now.

是初羯磨。」
This is the first communal action."

如是第二、第三說。
Say this a second and third time.

「僧已與某甲、某甲不癡毘尼滅竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」
"The Sangha has now completed granting so-and-so the non-mad Vinaya pardon, and with the Sangha's silent consent, it is thus held."

佛問諸比丘：「已與難提、鉢遮難提不癡毘尼未？」
The Buddha asked the monks, "Have you granted Nandi and Bhadranandi the non-mad Vinaya pardon?"

答言：「已與。世尊！」
They replied, "We have, World-Honored One!"

佛言：「五法成就，非法與不癡毘尼。何等五？
The Buddha said, "There are five factors needed to properly grant the non-mad Vinaya. What are the five?

不癡癡想與、不請求舉事人使心柔軟、
Granting when considering a sane person as insane, not requesting someone to soften their heart,

不從僧乞不癡毘尼、非法、不和合，
Not asking the Sangha for the non-mad Vinaya, unlawfully, and without harmony,

是名成就五非法與不癡毘尼滅。
These are known as the five improper conditions to grant the non-mad Vinaya.

成就五，如法與不癡毘尼。
Five proper conditions fulfill lawful granting of the non-mad Vinaya.

何等五？不癡不癡想與、求請舉事人使心柔軟、
What are the five? Granting when considering an insane person as sane, requesting someone to soften their heart,

從僧乞不癡毘尼、如法、和合，
Asking the Sangha for the non-mad Vinaya, lawfully, and with harmony,

是名成就五如法與不癡毘尼。」
These are known as fulfilling the five lawful conditions to grant the non-mad Vinaya."



時尊者阿難往詣佛所，頭面禮足，白佛言：

At that time, the Venerable Ananda approached the Buddha, made obeisance by touching his head to the Buddha’s feet, and said:

「世尊！所謂不癡毘尼，云何名不癡毘尼？」

"World-Honored One! What is meant by the term 'Non-Deluded Vinaya'?"

佛告阿難：「有比丘本癡、今不癡，諸梵行人說前癡行，

The Buddha told Ananda: "There is a monk who was originally deluded and is now not deluded; all practitioners comment on his past deluded conduct.

爾時應疾疾集僧。

At that time, the assembly should quickly gather.

集僧已，如修多羅、如毘尼，隨此比丘事實，與不癡毘尼。

After assembling, according to the sutras and Vinaya, address the matter of this monk with the Non-Deluded Vinaya.

如是阿難！如法、如律、如世尊教，

In this way, Ananda, according to the Dharma, according to the Vinaya, and according to the World-Honored One's teachings,

以不癡毘尼滅誹謗諍事已，若客比丘乃至愚癡無智，

using the Non-Deluded Vinaya to resolve defamatory disputes, if a visiting monk, even if foolish and ignorant,

who, like cattle and sheep, continually raises such matters, will incur the Pacittiya offense.

是名不癡毘尼滅。」

This is called the resolution by Non-Deluded Vinaya."

誹謗諍罪諍者，若比丘比丘相說罪過，

Defamatory disputes arise when monks accuse each other of offenses,

若波羅夷，乃至越毘尼。

此罪諍用二毘尼滅，

These disputes can be resolved using two Vinaya methods,

所謂自言毘尼、覓罪相毘尼。

佛住舍衛城，時慧命羅睺羅到時，著入聚落衣，持鉢入舍衛城。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti, and at that time, Venerable Rahula, preparing himself, entered the city with his alms bowl.

次行乞食，得還精舍。
After going for alms, he returned to the monastery.

食已執衣持鉢著常處，持尼師壇，向得眼林，欲坐禪。
After eating, he placed his robe and bowl in their regular place, took a mat, and headed to the Blind Men's Grove to meditate.

中路見一比丘與女人作非梵行。
On the way, he saw a monk engaging in non-celibate behavior with a woman.

見已，此惡比丘作是念：「佛子羅睺羅見我作非梵行，必語世尊。」
Seeing this, the evil monk thought, "Sariputra, the Buddha's disciple, saw me committing this misconduct, he will surely report me to the Blessed One."

及其未語間，我當詣世尊所，先說其過。
"Before he reports it, I will go to the Blessed One and confess."

時惡比丘詣佛所，頭面禮足白言：「世尊！我見尊者羅睺羅趣得眼林中路，共女人作非法事。」
Then the evil monk went to the Buddha, bowed at his feet, and said, "Blessed One, I saw Venerable Rahula on the way to the Blind Men's Grove committing misconduct with a woman."

爾時世尊默然不答。
At that time, the Blessed One remained silent and did not respond.

時尊者羅睺羅在一樹下，正受三昧，從禪定起，來詣世尊所，不憶惡比丘事，如常法頭面禮足，却住一面。
Meanwhile, Venerable Rahula was under a tree in deep meditation. After arising from his meditation, he approached the Blessed One, not recalling the incident with the evil monk, he respectfully bowed and stood to one side.

爾時世尊欲使羅睺羅憶向事故，即化作惡比丘在其前，羅睺羅見已，即發本識，白世尊言：「我向林中中路，見此比丘共女人作非梵行。」
The Blessed One, wanting Rahula to recall the incident, manifested the evil monk before him. Upon seeing, Rahula's memory was triggered, and he said, "I saw this monk on the way to the grove engaging in non-celibate behavior with a woman."

佛言：「羅睺羅！若彼比丘亦作是語：『我見羅睺羅中路作非梵行。』是事云何？」
The Buddha said, "Rahula, if that monk were to say, 'I saw Rahula on the way engaging in misconduct,' how would it be?"

尊者羅睺羅白佛言：「世尊！我無是法。」
Venerable Rahula replied to the Buddha, "Blessed One, I did not commit that act."

佛告羅睺羅：「若彼比丘亦作是言：『我無是法。』是事云何？」
The Buddha said to Rahula, "What if that monk also says, ‘I did not commit that act?’ How would it be?"

羅睺羅復白佛言：「世尊！若如是者，唯世尊知我。」
Rahula replied again to the Buddha, "Blessed One, if that is the case, only the Blessed One knows the truth."

佛言：「彼復作如是言：『唯世尊知我。』此事云何？」
The Buddha said, "What if he also claims, ‘Only the Blessed One knows the truth?’ How would it be?"

羅睺羅復白佛言：「唯願世尊！與我自言治。」
Rahula replied, "I ask that the Blessed One judge me by my own words."

佛復告羅睺羅：「若彼比丘亦如是言：『願世尊與我自言治。』者，復當云何？」
The Buddha said again to Rahula, "If that monk also says, ‘I ask that the Blessed One judge me by my own words,’ then what would you say?"

羅睺羅白佛言：「若爾者，願世尊俱與我二人自言治。」
Rahula replied, "In that case, I ask the Blessed One to judge us both by our own words."

爾時世尊詣眾多比丘所，敷尼師壇坐已，為諸比丘廣說上事。
Then, the Blessed One went to the assembly of monks, sat on a prepared seat, and explained the situation in detail.

說已告諸比丘：「與此比丘自言毘尼滅。
After explaining, he told the monks, "Apply individual judgment in this monastic code.

何以故？未來世或有惡比丘，誹謗清淨比丘，不得自言治，便驅出故。」
Why is this? Because in the future, evil monks might slander the pure monks and avoid judgment, thus should be expelled."

佛告諸比丘：「有八非法，與自言毘尼。
The Buddha addressed the monks, "There are eight improper behaviors judged by individual acknowledgment.

何等八？問重而說輕，輕事不實，是名非法與自言治；
What are the eight? When asked of a grave fault they speak lightly, or when they state the inconsequential falsely, this is considered improper.

問輕說重、問殘說無殘、問無殘說殘、問輕說輕、問重說重、問殘說殘、問無殘說無殘，如是一一皆不說實罪，是名非法與自言治。
When asked of light, serious, remaining, or resolved faults, each untruthfully spoken is improper.

有八如法與自言治。何等八？
There are also eight proper behaviors judged by individual acknowledgment. What are they?

問重說輕，實有輕罪而說輕，是名如法與自言治；
When asked about grave faults, they truthfully state them as light, this is proper behavior.

問輕說重、問殘說無殘、問無殘說殘、問重說重、問輕說輕、問殘說殘、問無殘說無殘，如是一一皆說實，是名八如法與自言治。
When asked about light, serious, remaining, or resolved faults, each truthfully spoken, is considered proper behavior."




爾時尊者阿難往詣佛所，頭面禮足，白佛言：「世尊！

At that time, the Venerable Ananda went to the Buddha, bowed down, and said, "World Honored One!

所謂自言毘尼滅，云何名自言毘尼滅？」

What is referred to as 'Vinaya extinguished by self-declaration'? How is it defined?

佛告阿難：「若比丘比丘相說罪過，若波羅夷乃至越毘尼罪。

The Buddha said to Ananda: "When a bhikkhu speaks of offenses, whether it's a 'parajika' or even a minor breach of Vinaya rules.

阿難！爾時應疾集僧。

Ananda, at that time, the sangha should be quickly assembled.

疾集僧已，如修多羅、如毘尼、如世尊教，

Once the assembly is gathered, as according to the sutras, Vinaya, and the teachings of the World Honored One,

隨此比丘事實，與自言毘尼滅。

Respond to the matter of this bhikkhu with a self-declaration to extinguish the Vinaya issue.

如是阿難！

In this way, Ananda!

如法、如律、如世尊教，用自言毘尼滅諍事已，

In accordance with the Dharma, the Vinaya, and the World Honored One's teachings, address the disputes with self-declaration to extinguish them.

若客比丘乃至更發起者，得波夜提罪，

If a guest bhikkhu then brings up the issue again, they incur a 'pacittiya' offense.

是名自言毘尼滅。

This is called 'Vinaya extinguished by self-declaration.'

罪諍覓罪相毘尼者。

For those who seek to find fault or quarrel over Vinaya."



佛住舍衛城時，長老尸利耶婆數數犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，眾僧集欲作羯磨事時，尸利耶婆不來，

When the Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, Elder Shiliyeva repeatedly committed the Sanghavasesa offenses, and when the assembly of monks gathered to perform the Kamma, Shiliyeva did not come,

即遣使往喚：「長老尸利耶婆！眾僧集欲作法事。」

So they sent someone to call, "Elder Shiliyeva! The assembly of monks is gathering to perform a legal matter."

尸利耶婆念言：「正當為我故作羯磨耳。」即心生恐怖，不得已而來。

Shiliyeva thought, "They are performing the Kamma because of me." He then became fearful and came unwillingly.

諸比丘問言：「長老！犯僧伽婆尸沙罪耶？」答言：「犯。」

The monks asked, "Elder! Do you commit the Sanghavasesa offense?" He replied, "Yes, I did."

彼生歡喜心，作是念：「梵行人於我邊舉可懺悔事，非不可治事。」

He felt joyful and thought, "The celibate practitioner raised something to repent with me, not something that cannot be dealt with."

白眾僧言：「聽我小出。」

He informed the assembly of monks, "Please allow me to step out for a moment."

諸比丘於後作是言：「此比丘輕躁、是不定人，出去已，須臾當作妄語。

Later, the monks said, "This monk is frivolous and unreliable; once he steps out, he will soon lie.

應當三過定實問已，然後作羯磨。」

We should question him three times to confirm and then perform the Kamma."

尸利耶婆出已，作是念：「我何以故受此罪？諸比丘數數治我罪，我今不應受是罪。」

Shiliyeva, after stepping out, thought, "Why am I receiving this punishment? Why do the monks repeatedly impose penalties on me? I should not accept this punishment now."

諸比丘即呼尸利耶婆入，入已問言：「汝實犯僧伽婆尸沙罪耶？」答言：「不犯。」

The monks then called Shiliyeva back in and asked, "Did you really commit the Sanghavasesa offense?" He replied, "I did not."

諸比丘問言：「向汝何故僧中說有是罪，復言不犯。」

The monks asked, "Why did you say you committed this offense in the assembly, and now you say you did not?"

尸利耶婆言：「我不憶是事。」

Shiliyeva said, "I do not remember this matter."

諸比丘以是事白佛，佛言：「呼尸利耶婆來。」

The monks reported this to the Buddha, and the Buddha said, "Call Shiliyeva here."

來已，佛以是事廣問尸利耶婆：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」

When he arrived, the Buddha asked in detail, "Is it true?" He replied, "It is true."

佛告諸比丘：「尸利耶婆眾僧中見罪言不見、不見復言見，作是語：『我不憶。』

The Buddha told the monks, "Shiliyeva in the assembly said he saw the offense then said he did not see it, then said, 'I do not remember.'

僧當與覓罪相比尼滅。」

The Sangha should perform Pabbajja to him who seeks the offense."

羯磨者應作是說：「大德僧聽！尸利耶婆比丘！僧中見罪言不見、不見復言見，自言不憶。

The Kamma should be declared thus: "Venerable Sangha, listen! Shiliyeva Bhikshu! In the assembly, he said he saw the offense then said he did not see it, then said he does not remember.

若僧時到，僧與尸利耶婆比丘覓罪相毘尼滅。白如是。」

If the time of the Sangha is proper, they should perform the Pabbajja for Shiliyeva Bhikshu. It is stated thus."

「大德僧聽！尸利耶婆比丘！僧中見罪言不見、不見復言見，自言不憶。

"Venerable Sangha, listen! Shiliyeva Bhikshu! In the assembly, he said he saw the offense then said he did not see it, then said he does not remember.

僧今與尸利耶婆比丘覓罪相毘尼滅。

The Sangha now performs Pabbajja for Shiliyeva Bhikshu who seeks the offense.

諸大德忍與尸利耶婆比丘覓罪相毘尼滅忍者默然，若不忍便說。

Those venerable ones who agree with performing the Pabbajja for Shiliyeva Bhikshu who seeks the offense, remain silent, those who disagree speak out.

是第一羯磨。」

This is the first Kamma."

第二、第三亦如是說。

The second and third are declared in the same way.

「僧已忍與尸利耶婆比丘覓罪相毘尼滅竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」

"The Sangha has agreed to perform Pabbajja for Shiliyeva Bhikshu, and since they are silent, it is carried out accordingly."

佛告諸比丘：「是比丘僧為作覓罪相毘尼羯磨已，是比丘應盡形壽行八法。

The Buddha told the monks, "After the Sangha has performed the Kamma of seeking offense, this monk should practice eight dharmas throughout his life.

何等八？

What are the eight?

不得度人、不得與人受具足戒、不得受人依止、

He should not ordain anyone, not confer the complete precepts on anyone, not accept anyone as a pupil,

不得受僧次請、不得作僧使行、不得與僧作說法人、

Not accept any invitation from the Sangha, not act as the Sangha's messenger, not perform the teaching on behalf of the Sangha,

不得與僧作說比尼人、不得與僧作羯磨人、

Not give instruction on the Vinaya for the Sangha, not perform the Kamma for the Sangha,

僧作羯磨已是比丘盡壽不聽捨，是名八法。」

And after the Kamma, the Sangha does not permit this monk to renounce until the end of his life; these are called the eight dharmas."



爾時尊者阿難往詣佛所，頭面禮足，白佛言：「所謂覓罪相毘尼，云何名為覓罪相毘尼？」

At that time, the venerable Ananda went to the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, and said, "What is meant by the Vinaya of seeking faults, how is it named the Vinaya of seeking faults?"

佛告阿難：「若比丘僧中見罪言不見、不見復言見，自言不憶作，觝慢。

The Buddha told Ananda: "If a monk in the assembly sees a fault and says he does not see it, or does not see it and says he sees it, claiming he does not remember doing it, being arrogant.

爾時應疾疾集僧，集僧已，如修多羅、如毘尼、如法，隨此比丘與覓罪相毘尼滅已。

At that time, the assembly of monks should be quickly convened, and once assembled, according to the Sutra, the Vinaya, and the Dharma, conclude the seeking faults Vinaya for this monk.

僧應語是比丘言：『長老！汝不得善利。云何僧中見罪言不見、不見復言見，自言我不憶作。』

The assembly should say to this monk: 'Elder! You do not gain good benefits. How is it that in the assembly, you see a fault and claim not to see it, or do not see it and claim to see it, and say you do not remember doing it.'

以汝僧中作是語故，僧與汝作覓罪相羯磨。」

Because you said such things in the assembly, the assembly performs the karma of seeking faults with you."

如是阿難！如法、如毘尼、如世尊教，與覓罪相毘尼滅諍已，若客比丘乃至更發起者，得波夜提。

Thus, Ananda! According to the Dharma, the Vinaya, and the teachings of the World Honored One, once a dispute over seeking faults is resolved, if another guest monk initiates it again, he incurs a grave offense.

是名罪諍用覓罪相毘尼滅竟。

This is called resolving disputes by means of the seeking faults Vinaya.

相言諍，用三毘尼滅。

For disputes over words, use the three Vinayas to resolve.

前已說現前毘尼竟。

Previously, the present Vinaya was explained.

多覓毘尼滅相言諍者。

Using the multiple Vinayas to resolve disputes over words.



佛住舍衛城拘睒彌，時有二部大眾，各有一師：一名清論，二名善釋清論。
The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, in Koshambi, where there were two large groups, each having a teacher: one named Purified Exposition, and the other named Good Explanation of Purified Exposition.

有一共行弟子名雹口，善釋有一共行弟子名坫雹。
There is a fellow disciple named Hail Mouth, and Good Explanation has a fellow disciple named Dian Hail.

第一依止弟子名頭頭伽，第二依止弟子名吒伽；
The first dependent disciple is named Totoka, and the second dependent disciple is named Jagana;

第一有優婆塞弟子名頭磨，第二優婆塞弟子名無烟；
The first lay disciple is named Head Mill, and the second lay disciple is named Smoke-Free;

第一有檀越名優陀耶王，第二檀越名渠師羅居士；
The first benefactor is King Udaya, and the second benefactor is named Ju Shi Luo Layperson;

第一優婆夷弟子名舍彌夫人，第二優婆夷弟子魔揵提女名阿㝹波磨；
The first female lay disciple is named Lady Shami, and the second female lay disciple is Maganandi's daughter named Apamama;

第一後宮青衣弟子名頻頭摩邏，第二後宮青衣弟子名波馱摩邏人。
The first palace maid disciple is named Pindola, and the second palace maid disciple is named Pravara.

各有五百比丘、五百比丘尼、五百優婆塞、五百優婆夷。
Each group has 500 monks, 500 nuns, 500 laymen, and 500 laywomen.

第一眾主入廁行訖，欲用水，見水中有虫，以草橫器上為相。
The first group leader went to the toilet, finished his business, wanted to use water, saw bugs in the water, and placed grass on top of the container as a mark.

第二眾主依止弟子，後來入廁，見水器上有草，便作是言：「是何無羞人？持草著水器上。」
The second group leader, a dependent disciple, later went to the toilet, saw grass on the water container and said, "What shameless person put grass on the water container?"

第一眾主共行弟子聞此語已，語其人言：「汝云何乃持我和上名無羞人？」
The first group leader's fellow disciple heard these words and said to the person, "How dare you call my teacher a shameless person?"

因此事故，二部四眾遂生大諍。
Because of this incident, the two groups of four assemblies started a great quarrel.

時拘睒彌國舉城內外諍鬪之聲，內外嬈動，猶如金翅鳥王入海取龍，水大波涌。
At that time, the whole city of Koshambi was filled with the sound of quarrelling and tumult inside and outside, like the Garuda king bird entering the sea to catch dragons, causing great waves.

如是大諍唯正共諍草非草，是故諸比丘鬪諍，
Such a great dispute was only about whether it was proper to argue about grass or not, and therefore the monks quarreled,

同止不和，說法非法、律非律、重罪輕罪、可治不可治、法羯磨非法羯磨、和合羯磨不和合羯磨、應作不應作。
living together in disharmony, discussing what is Dharma or not, Vinaya or not, grave or minor offenses, treatable or untreatable, lawful actions or unlawful actions, harmonious actions or disharmonious actions, what should be done or not done.

爾時坐中有一比丘，作是語：「諸大德！此非法、非律，與修多羅不相應、與毘尼不相應、與優波提舍不相應，
At that time, one monk among the assembly said, "Great Sirs! This is not in accordance with the Dharma, not in accordance with the Vinaya, not in accordance with the Sutras, not in accordance with the Vinayas, not in accordance with the Upadesha,

與修多羅、毘尼、優婆提舍相違，但起諸染漏。
indeed, they are opposed to the Sutras, Vinayas, and Upadeshas, only increasing defilements.

如我所知，是法、是律、是佛教，與修多羅、毘尼、優波提舍相應，如是不生染漏。」
As far as I know, this is the Dharma, the Vinaya, the Buddha's teaching, they accord with the Sutras, Vinayas, and Upadeshas, avoiding defilements."

是比丘言：「諸大德！我不能滅此諍，當詣舍衛城，到世尊所，當問滅此諍事。」
That monk said, "Great Sirs! I cannot extinguish this quarrel, I will go to Shravasti, to the Blessed One, to ask how to extinguish this quarrel."

是比丘到已，頭面禮佛足，却住一面白世尊言：
That monk arrived, prostrated at the Buddha's feet, then stood to one side and said to the Blessed One:

「拘睒彌諸比丘鬪諍，更相言說同止不和，乃至我不能滅諍事，我當往白世尊滅此諍事。
"The monks of Koshambi are in dispute, quarreling and not living in harmony, even I cannot resolve this dispute, so I have come to ask the Blessed One to resolve this issue.

唯願世尊！為諸比丘滅此諍法。」
May the Blessed One! Teach the monks the way to extinguish this quarrel."




爾時佛告優波離：「汝往與拘睒彌比丘如法、如律、如佛教，所謂多覓毘尼滅此諍事。

At that time, the Buddha told Upali: "You go to Kosambi Bhikkhu according to the law, according to the Vinaya, according to the Buddha's teachings, to extinguish this dispute known as seeking Vinaya.

如是諸釋種及諸離車等斷事時不可即了者，亦與多覓毘尼滅。

Such matters relating to the Sakyas and other disputes that cannot be resolved immediately should also be extinguished with the seeking of Vinaya.

優波離！諍事有三處起，若一人、若眾多、若僧；亦應三處捨、三處取、三處滅。

Upali! Disputes arise in three places: with one person, with many, or with the Sangha; and they should also be abandoned in three places, accepted in three places, and extinguished in three places.

優波離！汝往詣拘睒彌比丘所，如法、如律、如佛教滅此諍事，所謂多覓毘尼，如上現前毘尼中廣說。

Upali! You go to Kosambi Bhikkhu's place, according to the law, according to the Vinaya, according to the Buddha's teachings to extinguish this dispute, known as seeking Vinaya, as explained in detail in the preceding Vinaya.

乃至是比丘心軟已，僧應行舍羅。

Until the minds of these bhikkhus soften, the Sangha should proceed with the Sheladharma.

比丘有五法成就，僧應羯磨作行舍羅人。

Bhikkhus with the achievement of five qualities should be appointed by the Sangha for the role of conducting the voting procedure.

何等五？不隨愛、不隨瞋、不隨怖、不隨癡、知取不取。」

What five qualities? Not following desire, not following anger, not following fear, not following delusion, knowing what to accept and what to reject."

羯磨者應作是說：「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，能為眾僧作行籌人。

The procedure should be communicated thus: "Venerable Sangha, listen! Bhikkhu X has achieved five qualities and is capable of acting as the voting person for the assembly.

若僧時到，僧立某甲比丘作行籌人。白如是。」

If it is the time of the Sangha, let the Sangha appoint Bhikkhu X as the voting person. Proclaim thus."

「大德僧聽！某甲比丘五法成就，僧今立某甲比丘作行籌人。

"Venerable Sangha, listen! Bhikkhu X has achieved the five qualities, and the Sangha now appoints Bhikkhu X as the voting person.

諸大德忍某甲比丘作行籌人忍者默然，若不忍便說。」

If the venerable ones accept Bhikkhu X as the voting person, let them remain silent; if they do not accept, let them speak.

「僧已忍立某甲比丘作行籌人竟，僧忍默然故，是事如是持。」

The Sangha has consented to appoint Bhikkhu X as the voting person because the Sangha maintains silence, thus it is held.

羯磨已，此比丘應作二種色籌：一者黑，二者白。

Upon completion of the procedure, this Bhikkhu should prepare two types of colored counters: one black, one white.

不應唱言：「非法者捉黑籌，如法者捉白籌。」

It should not be proclaimed: "Those against the law take the black counter, those for the law take the white counter."

應如是唱：「如是語者取黑籌，如是語者取白籌。」

It should be proclaimed thus: "Those who say this, take the black counter; those who say that, take the white counter."

行籌人行籌時，當立心在五法內然後行籌，不應作不如法伴，當作如法伴。

When conducting the voting, one should fix the mind within the five qualities and then proceed with the voting; one should not act unlawfully but rather lawfully.

行籌訖數，若非法籌乃至多一者，不應唱。

After counting the votes, if the unlawful vote is more than one, it should not be proclaimed.

非法人多、如法人少，當作方便解坐。

If those against the law are more, and those for the law are fewer, one should find a way to adjourn.

若前食時欲至者，應唱令前食。

If it is before the meal time, it should be proclaimed to proceed with the meal.

若後食時至，應唱令後食。

If it is after the meal time, it should be proclaimed to proceed with the later meal.

若洗浴時至，當唱令洗浴。

If it is bathing time, it should be proclaimed to proceed with bathing.

若說法時欲至，當唱令說法時到。

If it is time for a Dharma talk, it should be proclaimed that the Dharma talk is beginning.

若說毘尼時至，當唱說毘尼時到。

If it is time to discuss Vinaya, it should be proclaimed that it is the time to discuss Vinaya.

若非法者覺言：「我等得勝，為我故解坐。我等今不起，要即此坐決斷是事。」

If those against the law say, "We have won; for our sake, the session is adjourned. We will not leave until a decision is made here."

爾時精舍邊若有小屋無虫者，應使淨人放火已，唱言：「火起！火起！」

At that time, if there is a small bug-free hut next to the monastery, a pure person should ignite a fire and proclaim: "Fire! Fire!"

即便散起救火。知近住處有如法者，應往喚言：

Immediately disperse to put out the fire. Knowing there are lawful ones living nearby, one should go and call out:

「長老向行籌訖，非法人多、如法人少。

"Elder, the voting has concluded, with those against the law being more and those for the law being fewer.

長老！當為法故往彼，使如法者籌多得佛法增長，亦得自益功德。」

Elder! For the sake of the law, go there, so that those who are lawful may gain more votes to increase the Buddha's teachings and also benefit personally from merit."

若彼聞此語不來者，得越毘尼罪。來已當更行籌。

If they hear these words and do not come, they incur a Vinaya offense. Upon arrival, the voting should be conducted again.

行籌已數看，若白籌多一，不應唱言多一，應作是唱：「如是語人多，如是語人少。」

After counting the votes, if the white counters are more by one, it should not be announced as more by one but should be proclaimed as: "Those who say this are many, those who say that are few."

作是唱已，應從多者。

After this proclamation, one should follow the majority.

更有五法成就，不如法行籌。

There are five more achievements, unlawfully proceeding with voting.

何等五？如法語人少、非法語人多、說法語人不同見、說非法語人同見、非法說法法說非法、因是行籌當破僧乃至僧別異，是名五非法。

What are the five? Fewer lawful speakers, more unlawful speakers, discordant views among Dharma speakers, concordant views among those who speak unlawfully, unlawful speakers discussing the law, lawful speakers discussing unlawfully; due to this, voting should proceed to disrupt the Sangha leading to separation, these are the five unlawful.

翻上名成就五如法行籌。

In reverse, these are named as achieving the five lawful proceedings.




爾時尊者阿難往到佛所，頭面禮足，

At that time, Venerable Ananda went to where the Buddha was and bowed down with his head at the Buddha's feet,

白佛言：「世尊！所謂多覓毘尼滅，云何名為多覓毘尼滅？」

and said to the Buddha: "World Honored One! Regarding the so-called numerous search Vinaya extinction, what is it meant by numerous search Vinaya extinction?"

佛告阿難：「諸比丘於修多羅中、毘尼中、威儀中，言此是罪、非是罪、是輕、是重、是可治、是不可治、是殘罪、是無殘罪，鬪諍相言。

The Buddha told Ananda: "The monks debate in the sutras, in the Vinaya, in the codes of conduct, saying this is a fault, this is not a fault, this is light, this is heavy, this can be rectified, this cannot be rectified, this is a residual fault, this is a non-residual fault, and they quarrel and argue with each other.

爾時應疾疾集僧，如法、如律、如佛教，隨其事實，如法如律斷滅。

At that time, it is necessary to quickly gather the assembly of monks, according to the Dharma, according to the Vinaya, according to the Buddha's teachings, follow the reality of the matter, and judge and eliminate it according to the law and the regulations.

若復不能了者，聞某方住處有長老比丘，誦修多羅、誦毘尼、誦摩帝利伽。

If still unable to resolve it, having heard of a certain location where there is an elder monk who recites sutras, recites the Vinaya, recites the Patimokkha.

如是若中年、若少年比丘，誦修多羅、誦毘尼、誦摩帝利伽者，應疾往問、若請來，隨彼比丘所說，與多覓毘尼滅諍事滅已。

In this way, whether middle-aged or young monks who recite the sutras, recite the Vinaya, recite the Patimokkha, it is necessary to quickly go and ask, or invite them to come, and follow the explanation of that monk to settle and extinguish the numerous search Vinaya dispute.

如是阿難！若客比丘乃至新受戒比丘，更發起者，波夜提。

Thus, Ananda! If a guest monk or even a newly ordained monk causes it to arise again, it is a transgression.

是名相言諍用多覓毘尼滅。」

This is known as using numerous search Vinaya extinction concerning disputes."

如草布地毘尼滅相言諍者。

It is like the Vinaya extinction where disputes are as common as grass spread on the ground.




佛住舍衛城時，拘睒彌比丘共諍，同止不和，說法非法、律非律，

When the Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, the monks from Kosambi were quarreling and unable to live in harmony, preaching non-Dharma and non-discipline.

乃至尊者優波離語彼比丘言：「長老！我往彼已應作羯磨，當作種種羯磨治擯汝等，爾時莫心不悅。」

Thus, the venerable Upali spoke to those monks, saying: "Elder! Once I go there, I should undertake the karmic acts to resolve and expel you. You should not be displeased at that time."

是使比丘言：「我欲小出。」出已作是念：「我若隨尊者優波離去者，或能苦治我罪，我等今當獨還拘睒彌自共滅此諍事。」

A monk said, "I wish to go out briefly." Once outside, he thought, "If I follow the venerable Upali, he may punish my offenses severely. Now, we should go back to Kosambi and resolve this quarrel ourselves."

到拘睒彌已，復不能滅諍事，復言：「長老！我自不能得滅此諍事，今當還到舍衛城滅此諍事。」

Upon returning to Kosambi, they still couldn't resolve the quarrel and said again, "Elder! I cannot resolve this quarrel myself, now I must return to Shravasti to settle it."

作是語已，即往舍衛城，往至尊者優波離所，作如是言：「善哉尊者！為拘睒彌比丘滅此諍事。」

Having said this, they went to Shravasti to find the venerable Upali, and said, "Good sir, help the Kosambi monks settle this quarrel."

優波離語彼比丘言：「故如我先語汝，隨彼有事，當種種如法治，汝爾時莫心不悅，當隨汝去。」

Upali told the monks, "As I told you before, depending on the issues, there should be resolution according to the Dharma. You should not be upset and should comply."

彼比丘答言：「不敢復違。」

The monks replied, "We dare not disobey again."

優波離言：「去還至彼滅，莫亂此間僧。」

Upali said, "Return to your place and settle it, do not disturb the monks here."

爾時拘睒彌比丘往到佛所頭面禮足，白佛言：「世尊！拘睒彌比丘同止不和更相言說，唯願世尊滅此諍事。」

At that time, the Kosambi monks went to the Buddha, bowed, and said, "World Honored One, the monks of Kosambi cannot live in harmony and constantly argue. We wish the World Honored One to help settle this dispute."

佛告拘睒彌比丘：「汝莫鬪諍，更相言說，同止不和。何以故？過去久遠世時，有城名迦毘羅，王名婆羅門達多，如《長壽王本生經》中廣說。」

The Buddha told the Kosambi monks, "Do not quarrel, argue, and disrupt harmony. Why? In the distant past, there was a city named Kapilavastu, ruled by a king named Brahmadatta, as extensively narrated in the Jataka tales of the Long-lived King."

佛告拘睒彌比丘：「彼有如是，破國亡家，乃至太子長生不報父讎，猶更和合不生惡心。汝等云何於正法中以信出家，而更忿諍，同止不和？」

The Buddha told the Kosambi monks, "Such events occurred in the past, yet the prince, though wronged with no vengeance, retained harmony without ill-will. How can you, who left home in faith to follow the Dharma, continue to quarrel and disrupt harmony?"

佛告優波離：「汝往為拘睒彌比丘，如法、如律、如佛教，如草布地毘尼滅此諍事。」

The Buddha instructed Upali, "Go to the Kosambi monks and resolve the quarrel according to Dharma, discipline, and my teachings, just as you would cleanse the earth with straw."

佛復告優波離：「諍事三處起，三處取、三處捨、三處滅，乃至是諍事淨者，當共優婆塞斷。」

The Buddha further instructed Upali, "Arguments arise from three causes, grasp from three aspects, discard from three aspects, and extinguish them. When purified, end the dispute with the lay followers."

若是不淨事，當喻遣優婆塞出，隨是比丘事實，如法如律，為作如草布地毘尼滅。」

If it is an impure matter, advise the lay followers to leave, follow the reality of the monk's affairs, and use the Dharma and discipline to eliminate it like cleansing with straw."

佛告優波離：「若是下座有過失，應詣上座所，頭面禮足，作是言：『長老！我所作非法，侵犯過罪，我今懺悔，不敢復作。』」

The Buddha told Upali, "If a junior monk has a fault, he should go to the senior monk, bow, and say, 'Elder! I have committed an offense against the dhamma, I now repent and dare not repeat it.'"

上座應以手摩其頭，扶起手抱，語言：『慧命！我亦有過，於汝當見善恕。』」

The senior monk should touch his head, help him up with a hand embrace, and say, 'Good disciple, I too have faults, and you should kindly forgive me.'"

若上座有過，應至下座所捉手言：『我所作非法，有過於汝，我懺悔不復作。』」

If a senior monk has a fault, he should go to the junior monk, hold his hand and say, 'The offense I committed against you, I repent and will not repeat.'"

下座應起禮上座足，亦如上懺悔。」

The junior monk should rise, bow to the elder's feet, and also repent as mentioned."




爾時尊者阿難往至佛所，頭面禮足，白佛言：「世尊！

At that time, the venerable Ananda went to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha's feet, and said, "World-Honored One!

所謂布草毘尼，云何名布草毘尼？」

What is meant by the so-called Vinaya of spreading grass?

佛語阿難：「若比丘諍事起，同止不和，二部眾不忍，生惡心共相言，各各說不隨順法，不忍事起。

The Buddha said to Ananda: "If a dispute arises among the monks, leading to disharmony, and the two parties cannot tolerate each other, harboring resentment and speaking unkind words, each claiming they do not follow the right principles, and cannot bear the situation to arise.

阿難！爾時應疾疾集僧，如法如律，應一部眾中有宿德知事，因緣辯才明了說法不怯，讚歎和合眾僧功德，

Ananda! At that time, the monks should quickly assemble according to the rules and law. One who is experienced, knowledgeable, eloquent, unafraid to speak clearly about cause and effect, and who praises the merits of the united assembly should stand up among the group.

應從坐起，偏袒右肩胡跪合掌，向第二部眾，作是言：『諸大德！

He should rise from his seat, bare his right shoulder, kneel with palms together, and address the second party, saying: 'Venerable ones!

我等云何同一法中以信出家，而起諍事，同止不和？二部眾不忍，各各生惡心，

How is it that we, having left home in faith under the same Dharma, give rise to disputes and reside together in disharmony? The two parties cannot tolerate it, each harboring ill will,

共相言說，不隨順法，不忍事起，一切皆是不善思惟所致。

And speak against each other, not following the Dharma which results in these unbearable situations, all caused by improper thoughts.

今世苦住，後墮惡道。諸大德！當各各棄此諍事，如草布地。

Now we live in suffering and later may fall into evil paths. Venerable ones! Let each of us abandon these disputes as if spreading grass on the ground.

我今向諸長老懺悔，各各下意和合共住。』

I now apologize to the elders and humble myself to live in unity.

阿難！若第二部眾一切默然住者，第二眾中宿德聰明辯才者，即應起懺悔。懺悔法亦如上說。

Ananda! If the second party remains silent, those who are experienced, wise, and eloquent among them should initiate the apology. The method of apology should be as described above.

阿難！僧中有如是諍事起，應疾疾集僧，如法如律，如草布地滅此諍事。」

Ananda! When such disputes arise among the monks, they should quickly assemble according to the rules and law and spread grass on the ground to dispel these disputes.

佛告阿難：「此一切諍事，如相打相搏、牽出房種類、兩舌無根謗，

The Buddha told Ananda: "All these disputes, such as fighting, dragging each other out of rooms, slander without basis,

如是等罪皆應如草布地毘尼中滅。

And similar offenses should all be eradicated through the Vinaya of spreading grass.

如是如草布地滅已，客比丘，乃至新受戒比丘，更發起者，波夜提。」

Once they are eliminated by spreading grass, if a visiting monk or even a newly ordained monk initiates it again, it leads to an offense.

常所行事諍者，若僧所作事如法辦，如法結集、如法出、如法捨、如法與。

For commonly recurring disputes, if the monks conduct matters according to the law, such as assemblies, admissions, renunciations, and offerings as prescribed.

如是世尊弟子比丘眾所行無量事，皆於七滅諍止，一一事滅，是名常所行事諍，是故說。

In so doing, all actions undertaken by the World-Honored One’s disciple monks, countless as they are, are resolved by the seven methods to stop disputes. Each issue is resolved, and this is called the 'regular procedure for disputes,' and thus it is taught.




，廣說如上。  
The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, extensively teaching as above.

爾時尊者優陀夷到時，著入聚落衣持鉢入城，次行乞食到一家，為眾多女人說法。  
At that time, Venerable Udāyin arrived, donned his robe, took his bowl into the city, and, after proceeding to beg for alms from house to house, preached to many women.

時尊者阿難次行乞食到其家，見已問言：「長老作何等？」  
When Venerable Ānanda arrived at that house in his rounds, he saw and asked, "What are you doing, elder?"

答言：「我為此諸女說法。」  
He replied, "I am teaching the Dharma to these women."

尊者阿難語優陀夷言：「云何名比丘無有知男子而獨為女人說法？」  
Venerable Ānanda said to Udāyin, "How can a monk without wise discernment preach to women alone?"

阿難乞食，食已往世尊所，頭面禮足，以上因緣具白世尊。  
Ānanda finished begging for food, and after eating, went to the Blessed One, respectfully reported the matter in full.

佛言：「呼優陀夷來。」  
The Buddha said, "Call Udāyin here."

來已，佛問優陀夷：「汝實作是事不？」  
When he came, the Buddha asked Udāyin, "Did you actually do this?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」  
He replied, "Yes, indeed, Blessed One!"

佛言：「此是惡事。汝云何無有知男子為女人說法？從今以後不聽無有知男子為女人說法。」  
The Buddha said, "This is a wrong action. How can you, without wise discernment, preach to women? From now on, preaching to women without wise discernment is not permitted."




衛城，廣說如上。  
Further, the Buddha resided in Sravasti, teaching extensively as above.

爾時尊者優陀夷到時著入聚落衣持鉢入城，次行乞食到一家，為眾多女人說法。  
Then, the Venerable Udāyi wore village clothes, took his bowl, entered the city, and while begging for alms, reached a house where he preached to many women.

時尊者阿難行乞食到其家，見已問言：「長老作何等？」  
At that time, the Venerable Ananda came to that house while begging for alms, saw it, and asked, "Elder, what are you doing?"

答言：「為女人說法。」  
He replied, "I'm preaching to the women."

阿難言：「長老不聞世尊言：『無男子不得為女人說法耶？』」  
Ananda said, "Elder, haven't you heard the Blessed One say, 'No man may teach the Dharma to women'?"

答言：「阿難！汝不見此石人、木人、草人、畫人耶？一人便足，況復眾多。」  
He replied, "Ananda! Don't you see these stone figures, wooden figures, grass figures, painted figures? One man is sufficient, let alone many."

尊者阿難乞食，食已以此因緣具白世尊。  
Venerable Ananda finished begging for alms, and after eating, he reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「呼優陀夷來。」  
The Buddha said, "Call Udāyi here."

來已，世尊問優陀夷：「汝實爾不？」  
After he came, the Blessed One asked Udāyi, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」  
He replied, "Indeed, it is."

佛言：「優陀夷！汝云何以無心男子當淨人而為女人說法？」  
The Buddha said, "Udāyi! How can you, lacking intention, assume purity and teach the Dharma to women?"

佛言：「從今日不聽以無心男子當淨人而為女人說法。」  
The Buddha said, "From today on, no man lacking intention shall teach the Dharma to women.


復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Again, the Buddha dwelt in the city of Shravasti, expounding as above.

爾時優陀夷時到著入聚落衣，持鉢入舍衛城，乃至答尊者阿難言：「汝不見此抱上小兒、飲乳小兒、臥小兒耶？一人便足，何況多人。」
At that time, Uttara was putting on his village clothes, took a bowl, entered the city of Shravasti, and replied to Venerable Ananda: "Do you not see this child being held, suckling, or lying down? One person is sufficient, let alone many."

尊者阿難乞食，食已以上因緣具白世尊。
Venerable Ananda went to beg for food, and upon eating, he reported the entire situation to the World-Honored One.

佛言：「呼優陀夷來。」
The Buddha said, "Call Uttara here."

來已，佛問優陀夷：「汝實爾不？」
When he came, the Buddha asked Uttara, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
He replied, "It is true."

佛言：「優陀夷！汝云何以嬰兒當淨人，而為女人說法？從今日不得以乳下嬰兒當男子，而為女人說法。」
The Buddha said: "Uttara! Why do you regard infants as pure beings and expound the Dharma for women? From today, you shall not regard infants as men and expound the Dharma for women."



衛城，廣說如上。

Furthermore, the Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti and expounded as described above.

爾時毘舍佉鹿母病，尊者阿難晨起著入聚落衣，往問疾言：「優婆夷所患何似？不大苦惱不？」

At that time, Visakha's mother was ill. Venerable Ananda, having woken up in the morning and put on his robes, went to inquire about her condition, asking, "How are you feeling, laywoman? Are you not in great suffering?"

答言：「所患不差，不可堪忍，願尊者為我說法。」

She replied, "The illness is unbearable, and I wish the Venerable would preach the Dharma to me."

阿難答言：「世尊不聽無淨人為女人說法。」

Ananda replied, "The World Honored One does not permit a man who is not pure to teach Dharma to a woman."

優婆夷言：「若不得多說者，得為我說五六語不？」

The laywoman said, "If he cannot say much, cannot he at least say five or six words to me?"

阿難答言：「我不知得不？未敢便說。」

Ananda replied, "I do not know if it is allowed; I dare not speak immediately."

優婆夷言：「和南阿闍梨。」

The laywoman said, "I pay homage to the teacher."

阿難言：「疾患速除。」言已便去。

Ananda said, "May your illness quickly depart." After saying this, he left.

尊者阿難還至佛所，頭面禮足却住一面，佛知而故問：「阿難！汝從何來？」

Venerable Ananda returned to the Buddha, bowed his head to the feet, and stood aside. The Buddha knowingly asked, "Ananda! Where have you been?"

阿難即以上因緣具白世尊，佛告阿難：「毘舍佉鹿母是智慧人，阿難！汝若為說五六語，彼病便差得安樂住。

Ananda related the whole story to the World Honored One. The Buddha said to Ananda, "Visakha's mother is a wise person. Ananda! If you had spoken to her for five or six sentences, her illness would have been alleviated and she could have lived comfortably.

從今日後，聽無男子得為女人說五六語。」

From today onwards, a man may be allowed to speak five or six sentences to a woman."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集，以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told the monks, "Let all who dwell in the city of Shravasti assemble, and for their benefit I will establish a rule for the monks, so those who have heard it before may hear it again.

若比丘無淨人為女人說法，過五六語，波夜提。除有知男子。」

If a monk who is not pure preaches to a woman beyond five or six sentences, it is an offense. Except for a knowledgeable man."



比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhu, as stated above.




無有知男子者，若盲、若聾，亦名無淨人；
There is no knowledgeable man; if blind or deaf, he is also called an impure person.

若一盲、一聾，有此二人者，得當一淨人。
If there is one blind and one deaf person, these two together make one pure person.

雖有淨人，眠，亦名無男子。
Even if there is a pure person, when asleep, he is also called a man without awareness.




女人者

Women,

若母、若姊妹、若大、若小、在家、出家。

whether mothers, sisters, older women, or younger women, at home or away.




法者，佛所說、佛印可。
The Dharma is what the Buddha taught and what the Buddha approved.

佛所說者，佛口自說。
What the Buddha taught, he spoke himself.

佛印可者，佛弟子、餘人所說，佛所印可。
What the Buddha approved was spoken by his disciples or others and was endorsed by the Buddha.




說者，教誦解說。  
The speaker teaches and explains.




五六語者，有二種：長句、短句。
There are two types of sayings: long ones and short ones.

長句者，一切惡莫作。
The long one is: Do not commit any evil.

短句者，眼無常。
The short one is: The eyes are impermanent.




除有知男子者，若減七歲，不解好惡語義味，名為無知男子。
Except for knowledgeable men, those under seven years old who do not understand the meaning of liking or disliking words are called ignorant men.

雖過七歲，不解好惡語義味，亦名無知男子。
Even those over seven years old who don't understand the meaning of liking or disliking words are also called ignorant men.

若七歲、若過七歲，解好惡語義味，是名有知男子。
Those who are seven years old or older and understand the meaning of liking or disliking words are called knowledgeable men.




，清旦來禮塔。  
Again, there was a woman who came at dawn to pay homage to the stupa.

禮塔已來禮比丘足，白言尊者：「我欲聞法，願為我說。」  
After worshiping the stupa, she came to pay respects to the monk and said: "I wish to hear the Dharma, please teach me."

比丘爾時得為說一偈半。  
The monk was allowed to teach her one and a half stanzas.

是比丘入聚落，若更為先女人說五六語者，波夜提。  
If the monk entered a village and further spoke five or six words to the woman first, it would incur a minor offense.

世尊所以制五六語者，一日中得說。  
The Buddha established that speaking five or six words is allowable in a single day.

若比丘在阿練若處住，有女人來禮塔，  
If a monk resided in a forest dwelling and a woman came to worship the stupa,

禮塔已次來禮比丘足，白言：「尊者願為我說法。」  
After worshiping the stupa, she came to pay respects to the monk and said: "Venerable, please teach me the Dharma."

比丘應語彼女人言：「世尊制戒，無淨人不得為女人說法。」  
The monk should say to the woman: "The Buddha established a rule that without a virtuous person present, we cannot teach the Dharma to women."

女人白比丘言：「我知佛法，如世尊所聽，願為我說。」  
The woman replied to the monk: "I understand Buddhist teachings as the Buddha permits; please teach me."

比丘爾時得為此女說一偈半，若二女人得齊三偈，無罪。  
At that time, the monk could teach the woman one and a half stanzas; if there were two women, he could teach up to three stanzas without offense.

若比丘入聚落教化，有眾多女人來欲聽法，  
If a monk entered a village to teach and many women came to listen,

各各得為說六句，應語第一女言：「我為汝說六句。」  
He could teach each woman six sentences and should say to the first woman: "I will teach you six sentences."

說已復語第二女言：「我為汝說六句。」如是眾多，無罪。  
After teaching the first, he could then say to the second: "I will teach you six sentences." As such with many, there is no offense.

比丘出已，諸女送出，禮比丘足與別比丘，  
After the monk departed, the women escorted him, paid respects to the monk, and then separated from him.

爾時若呪願言：「使汝速盡苦際。」得波夜提。  
If at that time he uttered a blessing saying, "May you quickly be free from suffering," it would incur a minor offense.

若言：「使汝得無病安樂住。」者，無罪。  
If he said, "May you be healthy and live in peace," there is no offense.

出已復詣餘家說法，  
After departing, if he went to another house to teach the Dharma,

先女人復隨來在外遙聽，  
And the former woman followed to listen from outside,

比丘見已語言：「汝復來聽耶？」  
The monk, upon seeing her, said: "Have you come to listen again?"

答言：「爾。」  
She replied: "Yes."

比丘言：「汝深樂法，可聽。」  
The monk said: "Since you deeply enjoy the Dharma, you may listen."

是比丘得波夜提罪。  
The monk would incur a minor offense.

雖見此女人不共語，直為餘女人說法，  
Even if he did not speak directly to the woman but taught other women,

先女人雖聞，無罪。  
If the former woman heard, there is no offense.

若比丘為女人說法，時雖無淨人在坐，  
When a monk teaches Dharma to a woman, even if a virtuous person is not present,

聽有作人行來住息、向外向內、或閣上閣下，遙相見聞者，無罪。  
If someone passing by hears or sees from a distance, whether coming, going, standing, or sitting, there is no offense.

若俗人家向道，比丘在內為女人說法，  
If a layperson's house is oriented towards the path and a monk teaches a woman indoors,

雖無淨人，但路上行人不斷，得見聞者亦無罪。  
Even if there is no virtuous person, as long as passersby on the road can hear and see, there is no offense.

若路上行人斷無見聞者，不得為說。  
If there are no passersby on the road able to hear or see, teaching is not allowed.

若有女人來禮塔，禮塔已白比丘言：「尊者！此是何等塔？願語我名處。」  
If a woman comes to worship the stupa and, after worshiping, says to the monk: "Venerable! What kind of stupa is this? Please tell me its name and location."

比丘爾時得語言：「此生處塔、得道處塔、轉法輪處塔、涅槃處塔。」  
The monk at that time could say: "This is a birth stupa, an enlightenment stupa, a Dharma wheel turning stupa, a Nirvana stupa."

隨所問事事得答，無罪。  
One may answer questions as asked without offense.

淨人有四種：或見非聞、或聞非見、  
There are four types of virtuous persons: those who see but do not hear, those who hear but do not see,

或亦見亦聞、或非見非聞。  
Those who both see and hear, those who neither see nor hear.

見而非聞者，眼遙見比丘、女人，不聞語聲，廣說如是四句。  
Those who see but do not hear may see the monk and the woman from afar but do not hear voices; thus is explained in these four sentences.

見而不聞者，得越毘尼罪。  
Those who see but do not hear incur a minor infraction.

聞而不見亦如是。  
The same applies to those who hear but do not see.

非見非聞，波夜提。  
Those who neither see nor hear incur a minor offense.

亦見亦聞，無罪。  
Those who both see and hear incur no offense.

是故說。  
Thus it is explained.



，廣說如上。  
The Buddha was dwelling in the wilderness city, teaching extensively as described above.

爾時有營事比丘，教眾多童子句句說波羅耶那。  
At that time, there was a monk in charge of management, teaching many young boys the verses of the Parayana.

時一婆羅門作是念：「何處有善勝法？我當於彼出家。」  
Then a Brahmin thought: "Where is there a superb teaching? I should renounce the world there."

作是念已，便往曠野精舍欲求出家。  
Having this thought, he went to the wilderness monastery wishing to become a monk.

見比丘教諸童子學誦，如似童子在學堂中受誦之聲，  
He saw the monk teaching the young boys to chant, similar to the chanting one might hear in a school.

時婆羅門作是念：「我今欲求勝法從彼出家，而此中喡喡似如童子在學堂中學誦聲，亦復不知何者是師，誰是弟子。」  
Then the Brahmin thought: "I want to renounce the world for the superior teaching, but here the chanting sounds like children in school, and I can't tell who is the teacher or who is the student."

彼人見已生不敬信心，竟不見佛即便還歸，不復出家。  
Seeing this, he lost his faith and respect, didn't see the Buddha, and returned home, not renouncing the world.

諸比丘以是因緣往白世尊，佛言：「呼營事比丘來。」  
The monks, due to this circumstance, reported it to the Blessed One, who said: "Call the managing monk here."

來已，佛問營事比丘：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」  
When he came, the Buddha asked the managing monk: "Is this true?" He replied: "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「此是惡事。汝云何教未受具戒人誦句法？  
The Buddha said: "This is a bad matter. How can you teach the verses to those not fully ordained?

從今日後不聽為未受具戒人說句法。」  
From today onwards, do not speak the verses to those not fully ordained."

佛告諸比丘：「依止曠野城者皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。  
The Buddha told the monks: "All monks residing in the wilderness city should gather. For the benefit, I establish a precept for the monks, even those who have heard before should hear again.

若比丘教未受具戒人說句法，波夜提。」  
If a monk teaches the verses to someone not fully ordained, it is a transient offense.


比丘者，如上說。
Bhikkhus, as mentioned above.




未受具戒者，除比丘、比丘尼，比丘尼雖受具足亦不得教。
Those who have not received the full precepts, except for monks and nuns, even if a nun has received the full precepts, she is not allowed to teach.




句法者，

Syntaxer,

若句味字、

like the taste of words in a sentence,

句味字共誦。

reciting the taste of words together.




法者，佛所說、佛所印可。
Dharma is what the Buddha has spoken and approved.

佛說者，佛自說。
What the Buddha has spoken, the Buddha declares himself.

佛所印可者，聲聞弟子及餘人說，佛印可之。
What the Buddha has approved, is spoken by the Śrāvaka disciples and others, then the Buddha approves.

諸善法乃至涅槃是名為法。
All good dharmas, up to Nirvana, are called Dharma.




教者，為說示語。

A teacher is one who shows and explains language.




波夜提者，如上說。

Po ye ti zhe, as mentioned above.




受具戒人言眼無常，聲一時舉、一時下、一時斷，聲合為樂不遮，波夜提。

If a monk teaches a person who has not received full ordination that the eye is impermanent, the sound rises, falls, and breaks at times, and combining sounds for pleasure is not obstructed, this is a transgression.

耳鼻舌身意、十八界五陰六界，乃至諸法苦空無常非我亦如是。

The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, the eighteen realms, the five aggregates, the six elements, and all dharmas as suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and non-self are likewise.

若比丘授共行弟子、依止弟子，《八群經》、《波羅耶那經》、《論難經》、《阿耨達池經》、《緣覺經》，如是等種種經，若共舉、共下、共斷，應如是教弟子言：「汝待我誦斷，汝當誦。」

If a monk teaches a fellow-practitioner disciple or a dependent disciple, regarding the "Eight Assemblies Sutra", the "Parayana Sutra", the "Debate Sutra", the "Anavatapta Pond Sutra", the "Pratyekabuddha Sutra" and such, if collectively raised, lowered, or concluded, he should instruct the disciple thus: "Wait for me to complete my recitation, then you should recite."

若如是教，不受語者不復得教。

If taught in this way, those who do not accept the teaching are no longer taught.

若彼弟子作是言：「願阿闍梨更授我經。」師爾時應語言：「若汝不復俱誦者，我當授汝。」

If a disciple says, "May the teacher teach me more sutras," the teacher should say at that time, "If you can no longer recite with me, I will teach you."

如是等弟子乃至優婆塞、優婆夷不得授。

Such disciples, even up to the laymen and laywomen, should not be instructed.

若比丘共誦經，上座應誦，下座心中默逐。

If monks recite sutras together, the senior monk should recite, and the junior monk should follow silently in his mind.

若上座誦不利者，下座應誦，上座應心默誦逐，乃至優婆夷亦如是。

If the senior monk is unable to recite fluently, the junior monk should recite, and the senior monk should follow silently in his mind, and even laywomen should do the same.

若僧中唱說偈時，不得同說一偈，得同時各各別說餘偈。

If in the assembly monks recite verses, they should not recite the same verse together, but may each recite different verses at the same time.

是故說。

Thus it is said.


佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha was staying in the city of Śrāvastī and extensively spoke as above.

如第四戒妄語中，事事因緣廣說。
As in the fourth precept on false speech, all matters and conditions were explained in detail.

但此中以說實為異，乃至佛語比丘：
But here, speaking the truth was considered different, and the Buddha said to the monks:

「此是惡事。譬如婬女賣色自活，汝等亦爾，
"This is an evil deed. Like a prostitute who sells her beauty to make a living, you all are the same,

乃以微妙實法向人說，為口腹故賣色活命。」
explaining the profound true Dharma to people and, for the sake of sustenance, sell its essence to live."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者盡集，
The Buddha told the monks, "Let all those residing near the city of Śrāvastī gather,

以十利故與諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
for the sake of ten benefits, I lay down this precept for the monks, and even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘自稱得過人法，我如是知、如是見，說實者，波夜提。」
If a monk claims to have attained superhuman states, saying, 'I know thus, I see thus,' and tells the truth, it is a pācittiya offense."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as explained above.




自稱過人法，過人法如上說。
Claiming superior knowledge or practices is as described above.

若自言：「我法智耶？」越毘尼心悔。
If someone asks, "Am I wise in the Dharma?" it leads to remorse.

若言：「我法智。」越毘尼罪。
If one says, "I am wise in the Dharma," it is a Vinaya offense.

若言：「我得法智作證。」波夜提。
If one says, "I have attained Dharma wisdom as evidence," it results in a serious offence.

句句如上廣說，乃至十無學法，說實者，波夜提。
For each statement as explained above, up to the ten skills in study, if truth is told, it results in a penalty.

若比丘語女人言：「某處夏安居比丘盡非凡夫。」得越毘尼心悔。
If a monk tells a woman, "The monks in such and such a place are not ordinary people," it results in remorse of offense.

問言：「尊者亦在中耶？」答言：「亦在中。」得越毘尼罪。
When asked, "Are you also among them?" if he replies, "Indeed," it consists of a Vinaya offense.

若優婆夷問言：「尊者亦得此法不？」答言：「得。」說實者，波夜提。
If a laywoman asks, "Did you also obtain this Dharma?" and one responds, "Yes," speaking truthfully results in a serious offence.

若比丘語優婆夷言：「某處自恣比丘非凡夫，皆是阿羅漢。」得越毘尼心悔。
If a monk tells a laywoman, "The monks in such a place during the confession period are not ordinary but are all Arhats," it leads to remorse of offense.

優婆夷言：「尊者亦彼間自恣耶？」答言：「如是。」得越毘尼罪。
When the laywoman asks, "Are you also among those confessing?" and the reply is, "Yes," it becomes a Vinaya offense.

復問：「尊者亦得阿羅漢耶？」答言：「得。」說實者，波夜提罪。
When further asked, "Have you also achieved Arhatship?" and answering, "Yes," truth-telling results in severe offence.

若復言：「某處繩里比丘，王家、大臣家、長者家、居士家、汝家，為汝家眷屬授經。」
If further stated, "In such a place, monks are in the households of kings, ministers, elders, lay people, in your home, teaching scriptures to your family members."

比丘乃至如是去、比丘住坐臥、著如是衣、捉如是鉢、食如是食亦如是。
Monks live, sit, lie down in this way, wear such clothes, hold such alms bowls, and eat this kind of food.

若中國語向邊地說、若邊地語向中國說、若中國語向中國說、若邊地語向邊地說，若說義不說味，越毘尼罪。
If central country language is spoken to border regions, border region language spoken to central regions, or language is exchanged among similar regions, but meaning is given without essence, it results in a Vinaya offense.

若說味不說義，越毘尼心悔。
If essence is given but not meaning, it results in remorse of offense.

若說義說味，得波夜提。
If both meaning and essence are conveyed, a severe penalty is incurred.

非說義非說味，無罪。
If neither meaning nor essence is given, there is no offense.

若作書手相印，現義不現味，得越毘尼罪。
If during correspondence and sealing, meaning is apparent but not essence, it results in a Vinaya offense.

若現味不現義，越毘尼心悔。
If essence is apparent but not meaning, it leads to remorse.

現義現味，偷蘭遮。
If both meaning and essence are apparent, it is deemed a theft of Dharma.

不現義不現味，無罪。
If neither is apparent, there is no fault.

下至現阿羅漢相，越毘尼心悔。
Even showing Arhat traits leads to remorse.

是故說。
Therefore, it is stated.
