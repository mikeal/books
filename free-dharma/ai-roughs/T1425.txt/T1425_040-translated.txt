摩訶僧祇律卷第四十東晉天竺三藏佛陀跋陀羅共法顯譯  
The Fortieth Volume of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya Translated by Buddha Bhadra and Faxian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty  




一天晚上，有一百四十一个波浪剩下。

One night, there were one hundred and forty-one waves left.




佛住舍衛城，爾時迦梨比丘尼安居中受僧床褥已而捨遊行。
When the Buddha resided in Śrāvastī, at that time, a nun named Kāli was residing in a monastery, but she left and went wandering after receiving monks' bedding.

諸比丘尼以是因緣語大愛道瞿曇彌，乃至答言：「實爾。」
The other nuns reported this incident to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, who responded, "Indeed, it is true."

佛言：「汝云何安居中遊行？從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha said, "How can you wander during the residence period? From now on, this is not permitted. You who have heard should listen again."

若比丘尼，安居中遊行者，波夜提。
If a nun wanders during the residence period, it is a violation (pācittiya).



安居者，前安居、後安居。
Someone settled down, settled down before, settled down later.




行者，下至聚落宿，波夜提。
The traveler descended to the settlement to stay, [a place called] Boyeti.

波夜提者，如上說。
Boyeti, as previously described.




若比丘尼，安居中離界一宿，波夜提。
If a nun, during her retreat, spends a night away from the boundary, she commits a minor offense.

若王難、餘方賊來，若恐奪命、若畏失梵行者，去無罪。
If there is a royal emergency, an attack from bandits, fear of losing life, or fear of losing celibacy, there is no offense in leaving.

比丘尼安居中，無有求聽羯磨法為塔僧事而遊行，是故世尊說。
A nun in retreat should not seek permission for any formal act or travel for stupa matters, thus spoke the Blessed One.




，

The Buddha resided in Śrāvastī.

爾時比丘尼舍衛城安居竟，來詣比舍離。

At that time, a nun who had resided at Śrāvastī completed her retreat and came to Vaiśālī.

往到跋陀羅比丘尼親里家，其家人問：「何處安居？」

She went to the home of a relative of the nun Bhadrā, and the family asked, "Where did you reside?"

答言：「舍衛城。」

She replied, "In Śrāvastī."

問：「舍衛城何似？好不？」

They asked, "What is Śrāvastī like? Is it good?"

比丘尼言：「祇洹樹林華果茂盛、池水清涼，精舍如是、世尊住處如是，尊者舍利弗、大目連如是，須達居士如是。」

The nun said, "The Jetavana grove is lush with flowers and fruit, the pools are cool and clear, the monasteries are such, the residence of the Blessed One is like this, and such are the venerables Śāriputra and Mahā Maudgalyāyana, as well as the layman Anāthapiṇḍada."

檀越言：「此是真出家。」

The patron said, "This is truly a place for renunciation."

「今我跋陀羅，此處生、此處長，如無手足人，初不肯出。」

"As for Bhadrā, she was born and raised here; she is like a person without hands and feet, unwilling to leave for the first time."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」

The nuns reported this matter to the Blessed One, who then replied, "Indeed, it is so."

佛言：「汝云何安居竟而不遊行？從今已後不聽。」

The Buddha said, "Why did you not travel after your residence period was over? From now on, this will not be allowed."

乃至已聞者當重聞。

Those who have heard it before should hear it again.

若比丘尼，安居竟不遊行者，波夜提。

If a nun, after completing her residence, does not travel, it is a pācittiya offense.


安居竟者，三月竟。
The one who lives peacefully, three months have passed.




不遊行者，乃至不出聚落行，波夜提。
Not traveling, not even leaving the settlement, is an offense.

波夜提者，如上說。
An offense, as previously stated.




安居竟乃至不離界一宿行，波夜提。
After residing, traveling beyond the boundary even for one night is an offense.

若羸老病不能行無罪。
If weak, old, or sick and unable to travel, there is no offense.

是故世尊說。
Thus has the Blessed One said.




佛住舍衛城，爾時偷蘭難陀語樹提言：「此間安居。」
Buddha lived in Sravasti; at that time, Sthula Nanda said to Sudatta: "Reside here during the rainy season."

即往檀越家歎譽：「樹提比丘尼賢善持戒，汝當供養於是。」
Then went to a lay-supporter's house and praised: "Sudatta the nun upholds her precepts well; you should make offerings here."

樹提威儀庠序，舉動視瞻不失儀法，見已生歡喜心，乃至後嫌訶惱觸。
Sudatta's manner was dignified and proper, her movements observed with decorum, inspiring joy at first, but later led to annoyance and complaints.

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」
The nuns, due to this reason, went to report to the Blessed One, who replied, "So it is."

佛言：「此是惡事，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha said, "This is a wrong deed; even those who have heard should hear again."

若比丘尼語比丘尼作是語：『阿梨耶！此處安居。』
If a nun says to another nun: 'Arya! Reside here during the rainy season.'

後嫌訶惱觸，波夜提。
And later receives reproaches and annoyance, she incurs a Pacittiya offense.



若比丘尼語：「是中安居。」

If a nun says, "This is the place to reside."

安居中惱觸。

Causes disturbances during residence.

惱觸者，若自身口、若使人身口惱觸，波夜提。

Causing disturbance, either by one's own actions or by making others act, is a breach.

若前人不持戒，畏作非法，雖驅遣無罪。

If the earlier person does not uphold the precepts, fearing to do illegal acts, there is no fault in expelling them.

若式叉摩尼、沙彌尼，越比尼罪。

If a probationary nun or junior nun does so, it is an offense for nuns.

乃至俗人，越比尼心悔。

Even laypeople who do so, nuns have remorse in their hearts.

是故世尊說。

Therefore, the World-Honored One said.



，爾時迦梨比丘尼，到欲安居時餘行去，受安居已還。
The Buddha was staying in the city of Śrāvastī, and at that time, the nun Kālī left to complete other activities during the rainy season retreat and only returned afterwards. 

房舍已分竟，方來索言：「是我房舍，還我！」住者言：「我已受，不可得。」
After the dwellings had been allocated, she came and demanded, "This is my dwelling, give it back!" The resident said, "I have already taken it, you cannot have it."

於是鬪諍。有善比丘尼呼言：「阿梨耶！可就此房住。」
Thus, a quarrel ensued. A virtuous nun called out, "Noble one! You can stay in this dwelling."

入已持巨摩柴草積聚房中，先住者言：「阿梨耶！此不用物不須安。」
Once inside, she gathered a heap of firewood and straw inside the dwelling, and the previous resident said, "Noble one! This is not needed, you shouldn't do that."

即言：「賢善！汝買得此房耶？」答言：「我當次得此僧房，若是僧房者我何以不安？」
She replied, "Good person! Did you purchase this dwelling?" He answered, "I was next in line to obtain this monastic room; if it is a monastic room, why shouldn't I make it comfortable?"

於是以身口擾亂。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」
There was thus a disturbance in action and speech. The nuns reported this incident to the Blessed One, admitting, "Indeed, it is so."

佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何知他先安居已後來擾亂？從今已後不聽。」
The Buddha said, "This is a bad matter. How can you know that she previously settled and then later caused a disturbance? From now on, this is not allowed."

乃至已聞者當重聞。若比丘尼，知比丘尼先安居已後來，若自擾亂、若使人擾亂，波夜提。
Even those who have already heard should hear again: If a nun knows that another nun settled first and then arrives later to disturb—whether causing the disturbance herself or getting someone to cause it—it is an offense of expiation. 




知先安居者，前安居、後安居。
Those who know how to settle first, settle in front, settle behind.




擾亂者，若自身口、若使他身口擾亂，波夜提。
If someone causes disturbance, whether by their own speech or making others disturb, it is an offense.




若擾亂比丘尼，波夜提。
If one disturbs a bhikkhuni, it is a pacittiya offense.

式叉摩尼、沙彌尼，越比尼罪。
For a sikkhamana or samaneri, it is an offence of wrong-doing.

乃至俗人，越比尼心悔。
Even for a layperson, it is an offence of wrong-doing needing heartfelt repentance.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One said.



，  
Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti,

爾時有比丘尼，不先看牆外，擲棄大小便。  
at that time there was a nun who discarded excrement without first checking beyond the wall.

時有婆羅門新洗浴，著新淨衣巷中行，正墮頭上。  
A Brahmin, who had just bathed and donned clean clothes, was walking down the alley, and it fell right on his head.

婆羅門瞋罵言：「眾多人子沙門尼，污我如是。」  
The Brahmin angrily shouted: "Why has this child of the Shramana community sullied me like this?"

諸比丘尼往白佛，乃至答言：「實爾。世尊！」  
The nuns went to the Buddha and said, "Indeed, World-Honored One, it is true!"

佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何不審諦觀而棄不淨？  
The Buddha said, "This is a bad deed. How could you carelessly discard unclean things without careful observation?

從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。  
From now on, this is not permitted. Even those who have already heard this should hear it again.

若比丘尼，隔牆不觀擲棄不淨，波夜提。」  
If a nun throws unclean things over a wall without observing, it is an offense deserving expulsion."



隔牆者，隔籬牆。
The one beyond the wall is separated by a fence.




擲不淨者，大小便、洟唾、糞掃及洗手足水、髮、指甲。
Those who discard impurities: urine and feces, mucus and saliva, waste from cleaning, water from washing hands and feet, hair, nails.




不觀者，

One who does not observe,

不先看而擲。

throws without first looking.




若欲擲棄物時當先諦視，
First, carefully observe when you wish to discard an object.

若多人行者，當待斷乃擲；
If there are many people around, wait for them to pass before discarding.

若行人希者，當彈指乃擲。
If there are few pedestrians, snap your fingers before discarding.

若不視、不彈指而擲者，波夜提。
If discarded without looking or snapping, it’s a transgression.

若比丘不視而擲者，越比尼罪。
If a monk discards without looking, it’s a minor offense.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the Blessed One says.



，爾時波斯匿王東園池，不禁比丘、比丘尼入。
The Buddha was staying in the city of Shravasti. At that time, King Prasenajit did not forbid monks and nuns from entering his eastern garden.

爾時六群比丘尼往彼園中作世俗語話，大小便洟唾生草上，復以藕葉裹不淨放池水中。
At that time, a group of six nuns went to the garden, engaged in worldly talk, defecated and urinated on the grass, then wrapped the waste with lotus leaves and threw it into the pond.

明旦波斯匿王與後宮夫人，共詣園池遊觀。
The next morning, King Prasenajit and his consorts visited the garden to enjoy the scenery.

時後宮人閉在深宮不出來久，始得一出遊戲熙怡喜勇競，各占顧生草：「此是我許。」
The consorts, who had been confined in the palace for a long time, were joyful and engaged in fun activities, each claiming, "This patch of grass is mine."

而往捉之污泥其手，詣水欲洗，復見水上有裹，便作是念：「諸年少等聞我等出，必裹眾香以待我等。」
They touched the grass, soiling their hands with mud, and went to the water to wash. There, they saw something wrapped, thinking, "The youths must have wrapped it in fragrant items to welcome us."

即往捉取而污其手，即往白王：「此是何物不淨如是？」
They grabbed it, soiled their hands, and reported to the king, "What is this unclean thing?"

王即呼守園人問：「誰污此園？」
The king then called the gardener and asked, "Who made this garden dirty?"

白言：「更無餘人，昨日六群比丘尼在中作俗人，言戲而去。」
He replied, "No one else was here. Yesterday, a group of six nuns came, engaged in worldly conversations, and left."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至佛言：「此是惡事，乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The nuns, due to this incident, approached the Buddha, who said, "This is an immoral act. Even those who have already heard should hear it again."

若比丘尼，生草上大小便，波夜提。
If a nun defecates or urinates on grass, it results in a transgression.

若比丘尼，水中大小便，波夜提。
If a nun defecates or urinates in water, it results in a transgression.



比丘尼者，如上說。
A Bhikkhuni is as described above.




草者，一切草，大小便洟唾，波夜提。
Grass refers to all kinds of vegetation, urine and feces, mucus and spit, mentioned in Pāyatti.




若雨時生草覆地者，當在無草處行。
If grass grows and covers the ground during rain, you should walk where there is no grass.

若無空處者，當在瓦塼上、乾草木、牛馬𡱁上、人行處。
If there is no empty space, then walk on tiles, dry grass, wood, cow paths, or human paths.

若復無者，下至一木枝，令先墮木枝後墮草上。
If none of these are available, descend to a tree branch, letting it fall first on the branch then on the grass.

若經行處有草者，當於經行頭安唾壺。
If there is grass on the walking path, place a spittoon at the start of the path.

是故世尊說。
Therefore, the World-Honored One said.




比丘尼如上說。  
The bhikkhuni spoke as above.  




水者，有十種，如上說。
Water, there are ten types, as mentioned above.




如果在水中大小便、擤鼻涕、吐口水，就会造下恶业。

If you urinate, defecate, blow your nose, or spit in the water, it creates bad karma.




若雨時水漫溢者，當於高處大小便。
In the event of overflowing water during rain, one should relieve themselves at a high place.

若無是者，當於瓦石、乾草木上、牛馬𡱁上。
If this is not possible, use tiles, stones, dry grass and wood, or the backs of cattle and horses.

若復無者，當以草木枝承，令先墮木枝後墮水中。
If even these are not available, use branches to support and let it fall on branches first, then into the water.

若掘廁下有水出者，不得先於中大小便，先令淨人行，然後比丘尼行。
If digging under a toilet causes water to emerge, do not relieve yourself there first; let the cleaning person go first, then the bhikkhuni (nun).

若廁下有流水者，當安板木，令先墮板上後墮水中。
If there is running water under the toilet, place wooden boards so that it falls onto the boards first before the water.

若船上行時有廁處者，當安板木承，令墮板上後墮水中。
If on a ship with toilet facilities, place supporting wooden boards so it falls on the boards first and then into the water.

若無板者，以木枝承，令先墮木枝上後墮水中。
If there are no boards, use branches as support to let it fall on branches first and then into the water.

是故世尊說。
Thus spoke the World Honored One.



佛住舍衛城，爾時六群比丘尼遊行勸化，語女人言：「與我物，欲為諸比丘作食。」
The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī. At that time, six groups of bhikkunis went about exhorting people and said to the women, "Give us goods; we wish to prepare food for the bhikkhus."

女人即與，作是言：「至作食日語我，我當行食。」
The women then gave them and said, "Inform me on the day of preparing food, and I will deliver the meal."

時請尊者舍利弗、大目連、離波多、劫賓那，尊者羅睺羅，復請六群比丘，敷二坐，一與長老比丘，一與六群比丘。
At that time, they invited the venerable Sāriputta, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Upavāṇa, Bakkula, and the venerable Rāhula, and also invited the six groups of bhikkhus, arranging two seats, one for the elder bhikkhus and one for the six groups of bhikkhus.

爾時長老比丘，時到著衣持鉢到舍次第而坐，與尊者舍利弗白米飯、蒙巨羹、酥乳酪，如是轉與麁食。
At that time, the elder bhikkhus, when the time came, donned their robes, took their alms bowls, and went to sit in order at the hall, giving the venerable Sāriputta white rice, a grand stew, ghee, and curds, thus passing on the coarse food.

尊者目連與麁米飯、摩沙羹油乳，餘比丘與赤米飯摩沙羹，或有得飯不得羹，有得羹不得飯，乃至尊者羅云與赤米飯、麻籸、菜羹。
The venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana was given coarse rice, a stew with oil and milk, while other bhikkhus were given red rice with stew; some had rice without stew, others had stew without rice, and the venerable Rāhula was given red rice, sesame, and vegetable broth.

時諸女人復持種種好食來，問言：「與誰？」比丘尼便以身障長老比丘，示六群比丘，與白米飯、好羹、酥乳酪，自恣與。
At that time, the women again brought various good foods and asked, "To whom shall we give it?" The bhikkunis then stood blocking the elder bhikkhus, pointing to the six groups of bhikkhus and gave them white rice, good stew, ghee, and curds at their leisure.

諸比丘食已而去。佛知而故問：「舍利弗！得好食滿足不？」答言：「已食。世尊！」
After the bhikkhus had eaten, they left. The Buddha, knowing, purposely asked, "Sāriputta, did you get enough good food?" He replied, "I have eaten, Bhagavān!"

如是三問，答亦如是。如是一一問諸長老比丘，答皆如是。
He asked this three times, and the answers were the same. In the same way, he asked each of the elder bhikkhus, and their answers were all the same.

乃至問羅云：「何故色力不足？得好食飽不？」答言：「世尊！食油得力、食酥有色，食麻籸菜無色無力。」
Finally, he asked Rāhula, "Why do you lack color and strength? Did you get a good meal?" Rāhula replied, "Bhagavān, eating oil gave me strength, eating ghee gave me color, but eating sesame and vegetables gave me neither color nor strength."

問六群比丘：「得好食不？」答言：「世尊！我得白米飯、好羹、酥酪種種好食。皆是姊妹信心恩力。」
He then asked the six groups of bhikkhus, "Did you get good food?" They replied, "Bhagavān, we got white rice, good stew, various good foods of ghee and curds. This was all due to our sisters' faith and kindness."

佛言：「上座是誰？」答言：「尊者舍利弗。」
The Buddha said, "Who is the chief?" They replied, "The venerable Sāriputta."

佛問舍利弗：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」世尊！
The Buddha asked Sāriputta, "Is it really so?" He replied, "Indeed, Bhagavān!"

佛言：「此非法食。汝云何看是擾亂比丘僧而入捨心？」
The Buddha said, "This is unethical food. How can you overlook the disturbance in the bhikkhu order and harbor such thoughts?"

舍利弗言：「若世尊言：『是非法食。』者，若一劫、若過一劫不可得消。」
Sāriputta said, "If Bhagavān says that this is unethical food, it would not be digested in one or even many aeons."

於是即取鳥翮擿而吐之。
Then he took a feather and induced vomiting.

佛言：「呼六群比丘尼來。」來已，問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」
The Buddha said, "Call the six groups of bhikkunis." When they came, he asked them, "Is this really so?" They replied, "It is indeed so."

佛言：「此是惡事，汝云何知眾利迴與一眾？從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。」
The Buddha said, "This is an evil deed. How can you, knowing the group's benefit, grant to only one group? From now on, this is not permitted, and those who have heard shall hear it again."

若比丘尼，知眾利迴與一眾，波夜提。
If a bhikkuni, knowing the group's benefit, grants it to only one group, it is a pācittika offense.



比丘尼者，如上說。
A bhikkhuni, as stated above.




自知者，清晰而独立。

He who knows himself is clear and independent.

從他聞者，模糊且不牢。

He who hears from others is vague and insecure.



眾者，比丘眾、比丘尼眾。
Assembly, Bhikkhu Assembly, Bhikkhuni Assembly.




利者，八種，時藥、夜分藥、七日藥、終身藥、隨身物、重物、不淨物、淨不淨物。
Benefit items are of eight kinds: time medicine, night medicine, seven-day medicine, lifelong medicine, personal belongings, heavy things, impure things, pure and impure things.




迴者，選物向處已定，而迴與餘眾，波夜提。
For the one who turns back, the destination is already chosen, and turning back with the remaining group is a violation.

波夜提者，如上說。
As for the violation, it is as stated above.




若人來問：「我欲布施，當施何處？」

If a person comes and asks, "I want to give, where should I give?"

應言：「隨汝心所樂處施。」

You should say, "Give where your heart wishes."

若言：「何處功德大？」

If they ask, "Where is the greatest merit?"

當言：「施僧。」

You should say, "To the monks."

若問：「何處有好持戒僧？」

If they ask, "Where are there monks who uphold the precepts well?"

當言：「都無犯戒僧。」

You should say, "There are monks without violations."

若言：「何處有比丘、比丘尼自守少事，坐禪、誦經、不大遊行，恒使我得見此物。」

If they say, "Where are monks and nuns who are self-restrained, meditate, recite sutras, do not travel much, so I can always see such things?"

得語言：「與某甲。」

You should say, "With such an individual."

若比丘尼，知物向僧迴向己，尼薩耆波夜提。

If a nun knows that an item dedicated to the monks is redirected to herself, it's a Nisaggiyapācittiya offense.

若迴向餘人，波夜提。

If redirected to another person, it's a Pācittiya offense.

眾迴向餘眾，波夜提。

If a group redirects to another group, it's a Pācittiya offense.

眷屬迴向眷屬，亦波夜提。

If kinship redirects to kinship, it is also a Pācittiya offense.

一人物迴向一人，越毘尼罪。

If an item is redirected to one person, it transgresses a Vinaya rule.

比丘迴眾物與餘眾，越比尼罪。

If a monk redirects communal items to another group, it transgresses a Vinaya rule.

是故世尊說。

Therefore, the Blessed One said.



教誡隱處癰、  
Admonish to hide sores,  

離宿不遊行、  
Stay away and avoid wandering,  




安居後嫌責、
After living in peace, blame arises.

安居已後來、
After settling down, it comes later.




隔墙弃不净、
Discarding the unclean over the wall,

草水回向僧。
returning the grass water to the monk.




十四跋渠竟。
The fourteen rivers are all crossed.




比丘同戒七十、不同戒七十一。
Seventy monks have the same precepts, seventy-one have different precepts.

百四十一波夜提修多羅說竟。
The explanation of the one hundred forty-one Pratimoksha Sutras is concluded.




智慧是一种无上的德行。

Wisdom is a supreme virtue.

它让人们能够看到事物的真相。

It allows people to see the truth of things.

明八提舍尼法的根源在于明智。

The root of the Eight Divisions of Enlightenment lies in wisdom.

一个明智的人总是追求知识。

A wise person always seeks knowledge.

通过知识，他们找到了通向解脱的道路。

Through knowledge, they find the path to liberation.

法增长了他们的理解力。

The dharma increases their understanding.

这提升了他们的精神境界。

This elevates their spiritual realm.

并且引导他们走向觉醒。

And guides them towards enlightenment.




，爾時佛告大愛道：「如來一時在舍衛城。
The Buddha was residing in Savatthi, and at that time, the Buddha spoke to Mahaprajapati: "Once, the Tathagata was in Savatthi.

時六群比丘尼，酥市乞酥、油市乞油、蜜市乞蜜、石蜜市乞石蜜、肉市乞肉、魚市乞魚、乳市乞乳、酪市乞酪，
During that time, a group of six bhikkhunis went to the ghee market to beg for ghee, the oil market for oil, the honey market for honey, the sugar market for sugar, the meat market for meat, the fish market for fish, the milk market for milk, and the curd market for curd,

而食為世人所譏：『云何沙門瞿曇稱歎少欲、毀呰多欲？』
and they ate, causing laypeople to criticize: 'How can the monk Gautama praise contentment with few desires and condemn excessive desire?'

如比丘緣中廣說。
It is widely explained in the monks' context.

瞿曇彌比丘尼亦應如是學。
Bhikkhuni Gotami should learn in this way as well.

瞿曇彌！我一時住迦維羅衛釋氏精舍，聽病比丘尼索好食。
Gotami! Once, I was staying in the Sakya monastery in Kapilavatthu, permitting sick bhikkhunis to request good food.

佛告大愛道瞿曇彌：「依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told Mahaprajapati Gotami: "Gather all the bhikkhunis residing in Savatthi, so that those who have heard may hear again.

若比丘尼不病為身，白衣家乞酥、若使人乞，若噉、若食，
If a bhikkhuni, not being sick herself, begs for ghee from lay households, whether by sending someone or eating,

是比丘尼應向餘比丘尼悔過，如是言：『阿梨耶！我墮可訶法，此法悔過。』
she should confess her offense to other bhikkhunis, saying: 'Venerables, I have fallen into an offense that requires acknowledgment and confession.'

是波羅提提舍尼法。」
This is the rule concerning pācittiya offenses.

明雜跋渠初  
The bright mixed bag begins

坐法者  
The one who sits by law  




佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼初夜後夜加趺而坐，時有蛇來入瘡門中。  
The Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti when, during the first and later parts of the night, a bhikkhuni sat cross-legged, and at that time a snake entered through the sore.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道以是因緣往白世尊。  
The bhikkhunis spoke to Mahaprajapati, and Mahaprajapati, due to this incident, went to inform the Blessed One.

佛言：「應與某甲藥。」蛇不死而還出，即與藥而出。  
The Buddha said, "A certain medicine should be given." The snake did not die but instead came out after being given the medicine.

佛言：「汝云何加趺而坐？從今已後不聽。坐法者，當屈一脚以一脚跟掩瘡門。  
The Buddha said, "Why do you sit cross-legged? From now on, it is not allowed. When sitting, one should bend one leg and use the heel of one leg to cover the sore.

若比丘尼加趺坐，越比尼罪。」  
If a bhikkhuni sits cross-legged, it is a breach of discipline."




簟席法者，佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼敷簟席縫衣，竹篾傷小便道血出。
Regarding the rule on mats, when the Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, at that time a nun was sewing on a bamboo mat and got injured, causing bleeding.

The nuns, due to this incident, went to report it to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後不聽比丘尼坐竹席。
The Buddha said: "From today onwards, nuns are not allowed to sit on bamboo mats.

若縫衣時，若在講堂、溫室，巨摩塗地已縫衣。
When sewing clothes, if inside a hall or a warm room, they should sew on the floor smeared with cow dung.

若無者，當敷著床上、若膝上縫。
If such is not available, they should spread something on a bed or lap to sew.

若於竹簟席上坐，越比尼罪。」是名席法。
Sitting on a bamboo mat constitutes an offense. This is called the Rule of the Mat.




佛住舍衛城，

Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti,

爾時偷蘭難陀與眾多女人到阿耆羅河脫衣洗浴，

At that time, Surananda and many women went to the Ajiravati River to undress and bathe,

比丘尼先出，取女人莊嚴腰物纏腰已，

The nun came out first, took the woman's decorative waistband, tied it around her waist,

語女人言：「看我好不？」

and said to the women, "Do I look good?"

諸女人言：「我食欲人纏腰使細，欲令夫主愛念。阿梨耶用是何為？」

The women said, "We fasten the waistband to make it thin, hoping to gain our lord's affection. Why do you, venerable one, do this?"

比丘尼聞已。

The nun listened.

以是事具白大愛道，乃至答言：「實爾。」

She reported this matter in full to the Great Love Path (an esteemed monk), and was answered, "Indeed."

世尊！佛言：「此是惡事，從今已後不聽比丘尼纏腰。

World-Honored One! Buddha said, "This is an improper act; from now on nuns are not allowed to wear waistbands.

若用女人纏腰物纏腰，越比尼罪。

If a nun uses a woman's waistband, it is a breach of the nun's precepts.

若有癰瘡，纏腰無罪。」

If there are boils, tying the waist is not a sin."




，

The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī,

爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼共眾多女人到阿耆羅河邊，

At that time, the nun Stulananda went with many women to the bank of the Achiravati River,

脫衣放一處入水洗浴。

and removed their clothes, placing them aside, before entering the water to bathe.

先出岸上，著女人襏衣，

Afterwards, she came ashore first and put on a woman's robe,

語諸女人言：「看我宜著不？」

saying to the other women, "Do I look suitable in this?"

女人言：「我是俗人，著此已欲令夫主愛念，汝用著是為？」

The women replied, "We are laypeople, we wear this to make our husbands love us, why do you wear it?"

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」

The nuns, because of this incident, went to inform the Blessed One, who replied, "It is indeed true."

佛言：「從今日後不聽著襏衣。」

The Buddha said, "From this day forth, wearing such robes is not allowed."


襏衣者，珂貝、琉璃、真珠、玉、金銀、摩尼如是比莊嚴陰衣不聽著，
The patched robes, adorned with shells, glass, pearls, jade, gold, silver, and gems, are not permitted as inner garments.

下至結縷作陰衣相，越比尼罪。
Even to the extent of knitting threads to make inner garments, it is a transgression of the monastic rules.

若陰上有癰瘡，裹者無罪。
If there are sores below the abdomen, wrapping them incurs no offense.

是名襏衣。
This is called a patched robe.




佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti,

乃至洗浴先出，

Until he bathed and came out first,

著女人莊嚴服，

Putting on women's adorned clothing,

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，

The nuns went to report this matter to the World-Honored One,

乃至答言：「實爾。」

And he replied, "Indeed."

佛言：「從今日後不聽著女人莊飾服。」

The Buddha said, "From this day forth, wearing women's adornments is not allowed."




女人服者，頭上光鍱額、耳鐶、鈴、瓔珞、指鐶、臂釧、脚釧如是比，一切女人嚴飾服不聽著。
Women’s attire includes headbands, ear rings, bells, necklaces, finger rings, bracelets, and anklets; such adornments for women are not permitted.

若著者，越比尼罪。
Wearing them constitutes a violation of the Vinaya rules.

若身有癰瘡，以藥塗纏無罪。
If one has sores on the body, there is no fault in applying medicine and bandaging them.

是名女人嚴飾服。
This is called women's adornment and dress.




佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼度釋種女、摩羅女、梨車女、大富家女，合嚴飾服而度出家。
When the Buddha was residing in Shravasti, a bhikkhuni ordained women from the Shakyan clan, the Malla clan, the Licchavi clan, and from wealthy families, all adorned in elaborate garments.

時諸貧家有女出門，及節會日行來，皆從借賃，為世人所譏：「此賃衣人非出家法。」
At that time, poor families had daughters who would borrow clothes to attend festivals and gatherings, and they were criticized by people, saying, "These borrowed clothes are not suitable for renunciation."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」
In light of this situation, the bhikkhunis approached the Blessed One and reported the matter, to which he replied, "Indeed, it is so."

佛言：「從今日後不聽合女人嚴飾服度出家，當令捨已而度。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, women should not be ordained while adorned in elaborate garments; they should renounce them first before ordination."




捨者，若女人來欲出家者，應令捨俗人嚴身具。
To renounce means that if a woman wants to become a nun, she should be asked to give up worldly adornments.

若作是念：「某時或穀貴乞食難得，或老病當須湯藥，女人少能得物。」
If she thinks, "Sometimes grains become expensive and alms are hard to obtain, or I might need medicine when old or sick, and women rarely get possessions."

當置人家。
She should be settled in a household.

若女人持俗嚴飾服來，合度出家者，越比尼罪。
If a woman comes wearing worldly adornments intending to become a nun, it is a transgression of the precepts.

是名合嚴飾服出家。
This is called being ordained while wearing worldly adornments.




佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti,

爾時釋種女、摩羅女、梨車女、貴人女，

At that time, women of the Shakya clan, women of the Mara clan, women of the Licchavi clan, and noble women,

將使人出家，使人端正，

were making people leave their homes to become renunciates, making people upright,

令與外人交通以自活命，

and engaging with outsiders to sustain themselves,

為世人所譏：「此非出家人，是婬女耳。」

and were criticized by people as "These are not renunciates, they are merely prostitutes."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，

Because of this matter, the nuns went to inform the Blessed One,

乃至答言：「實爾。」

and he replied, "Indeed."

佛言：「汝云何畜婬女以自活命？

The Buddha said, "How can you keep prostitutes to sustain your life?

從今日後不聽畜婬女活命，

From today onwards, it is not allowed to keep prostitutes for living,

若畜者，越比尼罪。」

If anyone does, it is an offense breaking the discipline of the nuns."

是名婬女。

This is what is meant by a prostitute.




佛住舍衛城，

Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti,

爾時世尊制戒，

At that time, the World-Honored One established rules,

不聽畜婬女。

prohibiting the keeping of courtesans.

爾時比丘尼便私畜園民女，

At that time, a nun privately kept a courtesan,

於外婬蕩以自活命，

who engaged in promiscuity outside to make a living,

為世人所譏：「此非出家法，是婬女耳。」

and was criticized by people: "This is not the way of renunciation; it is merely prostitution."

比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，

The nun, due to this matter, went to report to the World-Honored One,

乃至答言：「實爾。」

and confessed, "This is true."

佛言：「從今日後不聽私畜園民女、

The Buddha said, "From today onwards, privately keeping a courtesan is not allowed,

使人女作婬女以自活命。

nor should one allow others to engage in prostitution to make a living.

若畜者，越比尼罪。」

If one keeps such a person, it is an infringement of the nuns' precepts."

是名園民女。

This is called a courtesan.



佛住舍衛城，爾時有年少比丘尼，端正乳出，人見皆笑。
The Buddha was staying in the city of Sravasti. At that time, there was a young nun, beautifully exposed, and everyone who saw her laughed.

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白佛，乃至答言：「實爾。」
The nuns reported this matter to the Buddha and confirmed saying, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後當作僧祇支。」
The Buddha said, "From this day onwards, she should make a Sanghati."

作法者如上說，應先著覆乳衣，然後著餘衣。
As the practice is described above, one should first wear a chest-covering robe, and then other robes.

若不畜僧祇支，越比尼罪。
If she does not keep a Sanghati, it is a serious offense.

有而不著，亦越比尼罪。
If she has it but does not wear it, it is also a serious offense.

是名僧祇支法。
This is called the rule of the Sanghati.



佛住毘舍離，如跋陀羅比丘尼緣中廣說，佛言：「不聽裸身浴，當用浴衣。
The Buddha stayed in Vaishali, and as extensively explained in the Bhikshuni Bhadrakā story, the Buddha said, "Do not bathe naked; you should use a bathing cloth.

不聽裸形入河、若池水中浴，當著雨衣。
Do not enter the river or pool to bathe naked; you should wear a bathing outfit.

若裸浴，越比尼罪。若避隱處、無人處，裸浴無罪。」
Bathing naked constitutes a violation. Bathing naked is blameless if done in a secluded private place without people around.

是名浴衣法。
This is called the rule of the bathing cloth.




坐法并竹席、
Sitting on bamboo mats,

纏腰覆襏衣、
Wrapping around the waist, covering with a robe,




適合莊重裝飾的事物，  
Suitable for dignified ornaments, 

兼攝莊重裝飾，

让人园里的女孩，僧祇支撑浴衣。

Let the girl in the garden hold the priest's robe.




杂跋渠初竟。  
The various notes on the canal were finally completed.




，

The Buddha was staying in the city of Sravasti,

爾時比丘尼住處與俗人隔壁，

At that time, the dwelling of the bhikkhunis was adjacent to that of lay people,

比丘尼欲心起自手拍陰。

A bhikkhuni, arising lustful thoughts, slapped her own genitals.

時丈夫聞聲，即語婦人言：「此是何聲？」

A man, upon hearing the sound, asked his wife, "What is that sound?"

答言：「不知何故作此聲耶？」

She replied, "I do not know why this sound was made."

其丈夫言：「此出家人修梵行，欲心起不能自制，拍陰聲耳！」

The husband said, "It is the sound of a renunciant practicing the holy life, overcome with desire, unable to control it, and slapping their genitals!"

諸比丘尼聞已，以是因緣往白，

The bhikkhunis, having heard about this, went to report the matter,

乃至佛言：「汝實爾不？」

Until it reached the Buddha, who asked, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」

She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「從今已後不聽拍陰。」

The Buddha said, "From now on, slapping the genitals is not allowed."



拍者，手拍、若拘鉢拍、若鍵鎡拍，以歇欲心者，越比尼罪。

If someone claps their hands, or claps a bowl, or claps a implement, to calm their desires, that constitutes an offense against the Vinaya.

是名手拍。

This is known as hand-clapping.




佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼欲心起，作胡膠身生，縛著床脚，後失火，恐燒床褥故出之。
The Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at that time, a nun, motivated by desire, made a figure of paste and tied it to the foot of her bed. Later, a fire broke out, and fearing that it would burn her bed, she took the figure out.

時俗人看火起，何處被燒？何處不被燒？見已嫌訶：「云何出家人作此惡事？」
The people saw the fire and asked, "Where is it burning? Where is it not burning?" Upon seeing the figure, they reproached, "How can a renunciant do such an evil deed?"

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至答言：「實爾。」
The nuns took this matter to the Buddha and he replied, "Indeed, it is so."

佛言：「從今日後不聽作胡膠形。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, making figures of paste is not allowed."

胡膠形者，若胡膠作、若銅、鉛、錫、白鑞、若牙、若蠟蜜，如是比作身生，以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。
Figures made of paste, whether from glue, bronze, lead, tin, white metal, ivory, wax, or honey, all created due to desire, are forbidden.

是名胡膠形。
This is called a figure of paste.



佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī.

爾時大愛道往至佛所，

At that time, Mahāprajāpatī went to see the Buddha.

頭面禮足却住一面，

She bowed her head and worshipped his feet, then stood to one side.

時大愛道白佛言：「世尊，女人形臭，得聽洗不？」

Mahāprajāpatī said to the Buddha, “World Honored One, a woman's body has an unpleasant smell, may we receive permission to wash?”

佛言：「得洗。」

The Buddha said, “You may wash.”

時比丘尼洗外，內猶故臭，

The bhikkhuni washed the outside, but the inside still had an odor.

以是因緣往白，乃至言：「得洗內不？」

Due to this issue, she went back and asked, “May we wash the inside?”

佛言：「得洗。」

The Buddha said, “You may wash.”

洗法者，得齊一指節，不得令過。

As for the method of washing, it should be up to the length of one finger joint, no more.

若過洗，以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。

If one washes beyond this measure due to a desire, it is an offense of theft (stūlāntyā).

是名洗法。

This is called the washing method.




佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼有月期污床褥，大愛道往詣佛所白佛言：「世尊，得作月期不淨衣不？」
In Savatthi, the Buddha resided. At that time, a nun had menstrual stains on her bedding. Mahapajapati went to the Buddha and asked, "World-honored one, may we make menstrual clothes?"

佛言：「得。當持故布作，不得堅物作。又不得深內作婬欲想，當軟物障小便道。」
The Buddha replied, "Yes. You may use old cloth, but not hard materials. Also, do not insert deeply with lustful thoughts, use soft materials to block the urinary passage."

若用堅物深內，以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。」是名月期衣法。
"If hard objects are used deeply to quench lustful minds, it is considered a transgression (stulan)." This is the guideline for menstrual clothes.




佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼往女人洗浴處浣月期衣，
The Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti, at that time a nun went to a women's bathing place to wash menstrual clothes,

女人嫌言：「是沙門尼污此水赤乃如是。」
The woman complained, "This nun has contaminated the water, turning it red like this."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，
The nuns brought this incident to be reported,

乃至佛言：「從今日後不聽女人洗浴處浣月期衣。」
To the point that the Buddha said, "From today onwards, you are not allowed to wash menstrual clothes at the women's bathing place."

若浣者，越比尼罪。
If you wash them, it will be considered a transgression for nuns.

是名女人浣月期衣法。
This is the rule regarding women washing menstrual clothes.



佛住舍衛城，爾時世尊制戒，
The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti, and at that time the World-Honored One established a precept,

不聽女人洗處浣月期衣，
not allowing women to wash their menstrual clothes in the men's washing area,

便往男子洗處浣，
and if they were to go to the men's washing area to wash,

乃至「若比丘尼往男子洗處浣者，
even to the point that if a bhikkhuni went to the men's washing area to wash,

越比尼罪。」是名男子法。
it would be considered an offense of wrong conduct." This is called a rule for men.



佛住舍衛城，爾時世尊制戒，不聽男子洗浴處浣月期衣。
Buddha was staying in Shravasti city, and at that time, the World-Honored One established a precept prohibiting men from washing menstrual clothes at the bathing place.

時比丘尼到客浣衣處浣，乃至「不聽客浣衣處浣月期衣。」
Then a nun went to the guest washing place to wash, even though it was prohibited to wash menstrual clothes at the guest washing place.

當取瓫餘瓦器中於屏處浣。
They should take leftover water in earthenware vessels and wash in a secluded place.

浣時不得持水灑地，當著水瀆中無人見處，衣當曬令乾，後須時當用。
When washing, do not sprinkle water on the ground. It should be poured into a water channel where no one can see. Clothes should be dried in the sun and used when needed later.

若比丘尼於客浣衣處浣月期衣者，越比尼罪。
If a nun washes menstrual clothes at the guest washing place, it constitutes a transgression of the nun's rules.

是名客浣衣處。
This is called the guest washing place.




佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼欲心起，以小便道承懸注水，即失不淨，心生疑悔。
The Buddha was residing in Shravasti, and at that time a nun developed lustful thoughts. By directing a stream of water with her urination, she lost her purity and felt doubt and remorse.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道往白世尊。
The nuns spoke to Mahaprajapati, and Mahaprajapati went to report to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後不聽以小便道承懸注。」
The Buddha said, "From today onwards, do not direct a stream with urination."

懸注者，水懸注下。
Directing a stream means to allow water to flow continuously down.

若比丘尼於懸注水中浴時，當持衣物遮。
If a nun bathes in flowing water, she should use clothes to cover herself.

若以小便道承懸注水、屋簷漏水，以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。
If she directs a stream of water or uses water dripping from a roof to cool her lustful thoughts, she commits an offense of Stealing Virtue.

若於懸注水、屋簷漏浴者，不得以身向水，當背上。
If bathing in flowing water or dripped roof water, she should not face the water but should turn her back.

若以身向水以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。
If she faces the water to cool her lustful thoughts, she commits an offense of Stealing Virtue.

是名懸注水。
This is called flowing water.



佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼於急流水中浴，欲心生，逆水而行失不淨。
The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, and at that time, a nun, while bathing in fast-flowing water, developed desire and moved against the current, thus losing her purity.

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至「從今日後不聽於急流水中逆水觸小便道。」
The nuns reported this cause, leading to the declaration: "From this day forth, do not touch the urinary path against the current in fast-flowing water."

流水者，若山水、若急流水、若向流逆水以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。
As for flowing water, whether it is mountain water or fast-flowing streams, if one rests desire by moving against the current, it is a minor offense.

若於急流水洗時，不得向流當背。
When washing in fast-flowing water, one must not face the current with one's back.

若向流者，越比尼罪。是名流水。
If one faces the current, it constitutes a breach of the nun's discipline. This is called flowing water.



佛住舍衛城

The Buddha was residing in the city of Shravasti.

爾時比丘尼種種觸身出精

At that time, a Bhikkhuni experienced various sensations that led to emissions.

或蕪菁根、葱根、種種諸根內小便道中出精。

Sometimes, using radish roots, onion roots, various kinds of roots led to emissions in the urinary tract.

比丘尼以是因緣往白

Due to this incident, the Bhikkhuni reported it.

乃至「從今已後不聽若比丘尼用蕪菁根、葱根內小便道中出精

The rule was established: "From now on, a Bhikkhuni is not allowed to use radish roots or onion roots causing emissions in the urinary tract,

以歇欲心者，偷蘭遮。」

as it is considered a means to quell desires, it is an offense of stealing."

是名根。

This is called 'root.'



拍陰胡膠形、
Striking the form of the dark glue,

齊節月期衣、
Aligning with the clothes of the moon period,




女人洗處浣、

From various roots comes essence.

第二跋渠竟。  
The second Bapju is completed.




佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī.

爾時諸比丘集，

At that time, the monks gathered.

不知作舉羯磨，

They did not know how to perform the uposatha ceremony.

令比丘尼作已，

They let a bhikkhuni perform it.

比丘尼心生疑悔，

The bhikkhuni felt doubt and regret.

語大愛道，

She spoke to Mahāprajāpatī.

大愛道即以是事往白世尊。

Mahāprajāpatī then reported this matter to the Buddha.

佛言：「此上尊眾，

The Buddha said: "O revered community,

汝云何與作舉羯磨？

Why do you allow a bhikkhuni to perform the uposatha?

從今已後不聽與比丘作舉羯磨。

From now on, it is not permitted for a bhikkhuni to perform the uposatha for monks.

若比丘中都無能者，

If there is no one capable among the monks,

得授使誦。

They may be appointed to recite.

作羯磨時若不得者，

If unable to perform the ceremony,

遙授無罪。

Delegating it from afar is not an offense.

若比丘尼與比丘作羯磨者，

If a bhikkhuni performs the uposatha for a monk,

越比尼罪。

It is an offense for the bhikkhuni.

比丘得與比丘尼作羯磨無罪。」

A monk may perform the uposatha for a bhikkhuni without offense."

是名羯磨。

This is what is called the uposatha.



佛住比舍離，爾時跋陀羅比丘尼，著憍奢耶衣到親里家，
The Buddha was staying in Vesali, at that time, a Bhikshuni named Bhaddā, wearing a robe made of Kashaya cloth, went to her family's house,

道路值暴雨，如視水精舉見身體，眾人圍繞欲看，
On the road, she was caught in a downpour, and the robe became transparent like crystal, revealing her body, attracting a crowd wishing to see,

於是蹲地，依止弟子在邊而障。
So she squatted down, relying on her disciples beside her to shield her.

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至答言：「實爾。世尊！」
The Bhikshunis reported this incident, and Buddha answered, "Indeed. World Honored One!"

佛言：「從今已後比丘尼不聽著憍舍耶衣。」
The Buddha said, "From now on, Bhikshunis are not permitted to wear robes made of Kashaya."

憍奢耶者有二種：一者生，二者作。
There are two types of Kashaya: natural and manufactured.

生者，細絲。
The natural one is made of fine silk.

作者，紡絲。
The manufactured one is woven silk.

著細絲憍奢耶，越比尼。
Wearing fine silk Kashaya, one transgresses the Bhikshuni rule.

著紡絲，越比尼心悔。
Wearing woven silk, one transgresses but with remorse of heart.

比丘著無罪。
There is no offense for male monks wearing them.



佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī,

爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼大乳，

At that time, the nun Sundarī-Nandā had large breasts,

著一僧祇支於閣上經行，

She wore one layer of robes while walking on the upper floor,

俗人遙見自相謂言：

Worldly people saw from afar and said to each other:

「看是似如水上浮瓠。」

"Look, it seems like a gourd floating on water."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，

The bhikkhunis (nuns), due to this reason, went to report,

乃至佛言：

And said to the Buddha:

「從今日後當作覆肩衣。」

"From today onwards, one should wear a shoulder-covering robe."

覆肩衣者，襞疊拖覆肩上。

The shoulder-covering robe is folded and draped over the shoulders.

若不作不著，越比尼罪。

If not made or not worn, it is an offense for a bhikkhuni.

不聽比丘尼高處著一重僧祇支經行。

Nuns are not allowed to wear a single layer of robes on high places while walking.

若屏處著一重僧祇支無罪。

If worn in private places, wearing a single layer of robes is not an offense.

是名僧祇支。

This is called the Saṅgha robe.



佛住舍衛城，爾時釋種女、摩羅女、梨車女、貴勝家女出家，善知莊嚴，有嫁女娶婦，皆借倩莊嚴，得好飲食，為世人所譏：「此非出家人，是客莊嚴人耳。」
When the Buddha was residing in the city of Sravasti, women from the Shakya clan, the Mallika clan, the Licchavi clan, and the Vaisya clan renounced worldly life. They were well-versed in adornment. When brides were getting married, they borrowed adornments and received good food, leading people of the world to criticize them, saying, "These are not renunciants, but merely ornamented guests."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至佛言：「從今已後不聽莊嚴女人。」
Due to this matter, the nuns reported it, until the Buddha said, "From now on, women are not permitted to wear adornments."



莊嚴者，梳頭莊眼粉面朱脣，著嚴飾服以自活命者，越比尼罪。
Adorning oneself by combing hair, beautifying the face, and wearing elaborate clothes for livelihood is a pācittiya offense.

若有頭痛、眼痛得磨著藥無罪。
If there is a headache or eye pain, applying medicine is not an offense.

是名莊嚴法。
This is called the adornment rule.

At that time, the Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti,

爾時釋種女、摩羅女、大姓家女出家，  
At that time, women of the Shakya clan, women of the Mora clan, and women from great families renounced their homes,

種優鉢羅華取而賣之，  
They planted Utpala flowers and sold them,

為世人之所譏：「此非出家人，此是賣華女耳！」  
And the people criticized, "These are not renunciates; they are merely flower sellers!"

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」  
The nuns went to the Bhagavan with this matter, and he replied, "Indeed, this is true."

佛言：「從今已後不聽種華賣以自活命。  
The Buddha said, "From now on, selling flowers for a living is not permitted.

若比丘尼種優鉢羅華以自活命者，越比尼罪。  
If a nun plants Utpala flowers for a living, it is a transgression of the precepts.

為塔為供養佛故無罪。」  
There is no fault if it is done for the sake of stupas or offering to the Buddha."

This is called the Utpala flower.




佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti,

爾時比丘尼種須曼那華，

At that time, a bhikkhuni planted sumanas flowers,

乃至「為塔、供養佛故無罪。」

until the excuse of "For the stupa, to pay homage to the Buddha, there is no offense."




佛住舍衛城，爾時世尊制戒，不聽種華樹。
At that time, the Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī and had established a rule prohibiting the planting of flowering trees.

爾時釋種女、摩羅女出家，結華鬘賣以自活命，為世人所譏：「此非出家人，此是賣華鬘女耳！」
Then, women of the Shakya clan and Mallika women became nuns, weaving flower garlands to sell for a living. People criticized them, saying: "They are not true ascetics, they are merely women selling flower garlands!"

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至佛言：「從今日後不聽結華鬘。」
The nuns reported this incident to the Buddha, who then declared: "From today onwards, making flower garlands will not be permitted."



鬘者，優鉢羅華、摩梨華、須曼那華。
Garlands are made of blue lotus, jasmine, and champaka flowers.

結作鬘賣活命者，越比尼罪。
Those who make garlands and sell them for a living commit an offense against the monastic code.

若佛生時大會、菩提大會、轉法輪大會、阿難大會、羅睺羅大會、五年大會，
At major assemblies such as the Buddha's birth assembly, the enlightenment assembly, the first sermon assembly, the Ananda assembly, the Rahula assembly, and the five-year assembly,

檀越言：「阿梨耶！佐我結鬘。」

爾時得結種種鬘無罪。
At that time, it is permissible to make various garlands without committing an offense.

是名結鬘法。
This is known as the garland-making rule.

spun thread and sold it,

為世人所嫌：
and were criticized by the people of the world:

「此非出家人，
"These are not renunciants,

these are thread sellers."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，
The bhikkhunis reported this matter,

乃至佛言：
to the Buddha, who then said:

「從今已後不聽紡縷。」
"From now on, spinning thread is not permitted."




紡縷者，劫貝縷、芻摩縷、憍舍耶縷、舍那麻縷、紡縷。
The weaver uses Kappa threads, Choma threads, Kausheya threads, Shanama threads, and weaving threads.

賣活命者，越比尼罪。
Selling to sustain life is a Vinaya offense.

若欲作漉水囊、腰帶，紡者無罪。
If one wishes to make a water-filtering bag or belt, the weaver is without fault.

是名紡縷法。
This is called the method of weaving threads.




，爾時須提那死，婦出家，其叔常欲使罷道。
The Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī when Śuddhīna passed away, and his wife became a nun. His uncle always wanted her to give up the path.

時比丘尼入聚落乞食，叔遇見之即欲捉取，便走入一大家內，語婦人言：「異事，幾當壞我梵行。」
One day, when the nun entered the village to beg for food, the uncle saw her and wanted to seize her. She then ran into a house and told a woman inside, "An unusual thing, I almost broke my vow of chastity."

問：「何故？」答言：「叔欲罷我道。」
The woman asked, "Why?" She replied, "My uncle wants to make me give up the path."

婦人言：「莫恐，我當相護。」
The woman said, "Do not fear, I will protect you."

比丘尼言：「我欲向和上邊去。」
The nun said, "I want to go to the senior monk (Ēlder)."

婦人言：「汝欲去者，當著俗服假異摽相，乃可得脫。」
The woman said, "If you want to go, you should wear layperson clothes and disguise yourself. Only then can you escape."

即著臂釧耳鐶俗人服飾，又將四五人侍從而去。
So she wore bracelets and earrings like a layperson, taking four or five followers with her, and left.

其叔於外見之念言：「此非比丘尼，是俗人耳。」
Her uncle saw her from outside and thought, "This is not the nun, but a layperson."

到住處已，諸比丘尼呵言：「汝何故著此？」
When she arrived at the residence, the other nuns scolded her, "Why are you wearing this?"

答言：「我叔欲取我，方便自護故假著此耳。」
She answered, "My uncle wanted to seize me. I wore this as a means of self-protection."

諸比丘尼語大愛道，大愛道即以是事具白世尊。
The other nuns informed Mahāprajāpatī, who then relayed the matter to the Bhagavān (Buddha).

佛言：「呼比丘尼來。」
The Buddha said, "Call the nun here."

來已，佛問：「汝實爾不？」
When she came, the Buddha asked, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
She replied, "It is true."

佛言：「汝云何壞威儀？從今已後不聽壞威儀。
The Buddha said, "How could you break the precepts? From now on, breaking the precepts will not be allowed.

若決定壞威儀者非比丘尼。
If a nun deliberately breaks the precepts, she is not a nun.

若方便自護故壞威儀，越比尼罪。
If one breaks the precepts as a means of self-protection, it is a violation of the monastic code.

故名比丘尼。若比丘尼決定壞威儀者，偷蘭遮。
This is why there are nuns. If a nun deliberately breaks the precepts, it is a grave (Stūlānishiddha) offense.

若方便自護無罪。
But if it is done for self-protection, there is no offense.

佛住舍衛城，爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼乞食詣一大家，
The Buddha resided in the city of Sravasti, at that time a nun named Sunanda was begging for alms at a household,

時有婦人墮胎，語言：「為我棄之。」
when a woman there had a miscarriage and said, "Dispose of this for me."

答言：「不能。」
The nun replied, "I cannot."

又請：「我當顧爾許物。」
The woman then offered, "I will reward you with these items."

即取以鉢盛之而去。
The nun took and placed it into her alms bowl and left.

時大迦葉乞食恒作此念，最初得食，當施與若比丘、比丘尼。
At that time, the venerable Mahakasyapa, while begging for alms, always thought, upon receiving food first, he should offer it to a monk or nun.

見此比丘尼已語言：「取鉢來。」
He saw this nun and said, "Bring your alms bowl."

即覆不示。
She covered it and did not show him.

又復更呼，亦復不示。
He called again, yet she still did not show him.

大迦葉性有威風，厲聲而喚，即戰怖而示。
Mahakasyapa, being authoritative, called out sternly, causing her to tremble in fear and reveal it.

見已言：「咄！汝何故作此惡法？」
Upon seeing it, he exclaimed, "Why have you committed this wrongful act?"

時大迦葉語諸比丘尼，
Then Mahakasyapa spoke to the other nuns,

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊，乃至答言：「實爾。」
and the nuns reported the matter to the Blessed One, who confirmed, "It is true."

佛言：「此是惡事非法。汝云何覆鉢？
The Buddha said, "This is a wrongful act and not according to the Dharma. How can you cover the bowl?

從今日後不聽覆鉢，復不聽露捉，得食已當覆。
From today onward, you are not allowed to cover the bowl, nor to carry it uncovered. Once you receive food, you should cover it.

若見比丘時當舉覆示之。
If you see a monk, you should uncover and show it.

若露持鉢，越比尼罪。
If you carry the bowl uncovered, it is a violation of the rules for nuns.

見比丘不示，亦越比尼罪。」
If you see a monk and do not show it, it is also a violation of the rules for nuns."

是名鉢事。
This is called the matter of the bowl.



，爾時有大臣犯王法，其家財物盡應沒官，王即遣人守護。
Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, and at that time, a minister violated the king's law, leading his family's possessions to be confiscated by the government, with the king sending people to guard them.

時偷蘭難陀比丘尼乞食次到其家，婦人語言：「阿梨耶！我家有事犯王罪應至死，財物入官，我欲寄少寶物嚴飾之具。
Nun Sudanna, while on her alms round, came to the house, and a woman said, "Reverend! Our family has committed a crime against the king and we are supposed to be sentenced to death, and our property will be confiscated. I wish to entrust some jewels and adornments."

若我得脫當相顧直，我若死者即持相施。」
If I survive, I will repay you; if I die, please keep them as an offering."

時比丘尼即與鉢盛雜寶，覆已而去。
The nun then used a bowl to collect the assorted jewels, covered it, and left.

時守門人見之，問言：「鉢中何物？」而不示之，又復叱喚畏而示之。
When the guard saw it, he asked, "What is inside the bowl?" She did not show it, but after being scolded, she showed it out of fear.

比丘尼聞已往白，乃至答言：「實爾。」
The nun went to report it and answered truthfully, saying, "It is true."

佛言：「從今日後不聽覆鉢寶物。
The Buddha said, "From today onward, it is not allowed to conceal valuables in a bowl."

若有犯官事未被收錄，又未籍其財，爾時寄者得取。
If someone has committed an offense not yet recorded and their property has not been seized, the entrusted person may receive it.

若王收攝又籍其財，應語言：『世尊制戒不得受是。』
If the king has confiscated and recorded their property, you should say, 'The World Honored One has set a rule not to accept this.'

若言：『我與塔、與僧、施汝。』得取。
If they say, 'I offer it to the stupa, to the Sangha, and to you,' you may take it.

得已不得覆上而去，當露持去。
Once received, do not cover it, but carry it openly.

若有問者，當言：『塔物、僧物、我物。』
If questioned, say: 'It is for the stupa, the Sangha, and myself.'

若聽去者善，若不聽者當還。」
If permitted to leave, that is good; if not, return the items."

是名覆鉢法。
This is called the rule of concealing valuables in a bowl


佛住舍衛城，爾時比丘尼作廁，以物覆上。
When the Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti, at that time, a group of nuns constructed a toilet and covered it with something.

諸女人持死胎放中，後有賤人旃陀羅抒廁，見已言：
Some women placed a dead fetus inside, and later, a low-caste person, a Chandala, cleaned the toilet, saw it, and said:

「是沙門尼自墮胎擲中。」
"This recluse nun must have miscarried and disposed of the fetus inside."

諸比丘尼以是因緣往白，乃至佛言：
The nuns, due to this event, went to report it, and told the Buddha:

「從今日後不聽覆廁，當開口作。若閉口作者，越比尼罪。」
"From today onwards, it is not permitted to cover the toilet; it must be made with an open top. If someone constructs it with a closed top, it will be a violation of the nun's precepts."

是名廁法。
This is called the Toilet Precept.




佛住舍衛城，

The Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti,

爾時釋種女、摩羅女於浴室中浴，

At that time, women of the Shakya clan and mara women bathed in the bathhouse,

時有年少入中壞其梵行。

And a young man entered and corrupted their pure conduct.

諸比丘尼語大愛道，

The nuns told Mahaprajapati,

乃至「從今日後不聽入浴室。」

"Saying that from this day forward, the bathhouse is not permitted."

若病者得房內然火油塗而揩。

If sick, they may light oil in a room and anoint and scrub.

若比丘尼入浴室浴者，越比尼罪。

If a nun enters the bathhouse to bathe, it is an offense of expulsion.

是名浴室法。

This is called the Bathhouse Law.




，

The Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī,

爾時未制戒，比丘尼阿練若處、聚落中未有住處。

At that time, no rules had been established, and nuns had no dwellings in the remote areas or villages.

時五百比丘尼，大愛道為上首，於王園中住。

At that time, five hundred nuns, led by Mahāprajāpatī, were living in the royal garden.

諸釋種女、摩羅女年少端正，

Among the Śākya women, some young and attractive women of the Mora clan,

有諸年少初夜伺便欲捉比丘尼，

During the early night, some young men watched for opportunities to capture the nuns,

見已乘空而去。

Upon seeing them, they would fly away.

中夜復來亦復如是。

In the middle of the night, the same thing happened.

後夜復來，

During the late night, they came again,

中有鈍根、不時入定及睡眠者，不得即去，為所侵掠。

Some with dull faculties, who did not attain concentration or were asleep, could not leave in time and were abducted.

大愛道以是事往白世尊，

Mahāprajāpatī went to report this matter to the Blessed One,

佛言：「從今日後不聽比丘尼在阿練若處住，

The Buddha said: "From today onwards, nuns are not allowed to reside in remote places,

若四眾集竟夜說法者得住，爾時不得在屏處。

If the four assemblies gather to preach the Dharma all night, they may stay, but not in secluded places.

若比丘尼阿練若處住者，越比尼罪。」

If any nun resides in a remote place, she commits an offense of wrongdoing."

是名阿練若處。

This is known as a remote place.

比丘尼得從比丘受食，除金銀及錢火淨五生種。
Nuns may receive food from monks, except for gold, silver, money, fire purity, and five kinds of seeds.

有三因緣非比丘。何等三？
There are three reasons for not being a monk. What are the three?

心決定捨戒、有實事僧驅出、形轉為女，是名三非比丘。
Resolute abandonment of precepts, actual expulsion by monks, and transformation into a woman are said to be the three non-monks.

應遣詣比丘尼精舍，不得共比丘尼，同覆障應別。
Should be sent to the nuns' temple, not allowed to be with nuns, covering and obstacles should be separate.

若後還得男根者，當還比丘僧中，故名具足，亦復本歲。
If later regaining male attributes, should return to the monks’ community, thus called fully ordained, also returning to original age.

有三因緣非比丘尼。何等三？

心決定壞威儀、有實事僧驅出、轉形為男。如比丘中說。
Resolute destruction of dignity, actual expulsion by monks, and transformation into a man. As spoken among monks.

比丘尼無有作殘食法，一坐足自恣食。
Nuns do not practice the leftover food method; they may partake of food freely while seated once.



佛住舍衛城，阿耆羅河彼岸請二部僧食。

The Buddha was staying in the city of Sāvatthī, and the two groups of monks were invited to a meal on the other side of the Ajira River.

比丘、比丘尼俱欲渡，比丘言：「世尊制戒，不得共船載。」

Both the monks and nuns wanted to cross, but the monks said, "The Blessed One has established a rule that we should not travel together on the same boat."

比丘二人、三人輕船而渡，渡盡比丘尼渡，渡已問歲數，日時已過。

The monks crossed in small groups of two or three on a light boat, and after they crossed, the nuns crossed. By the time they asked for their age and date, the time had already passed.

時大愛道失食飢羸，到世尊所頭面作禮却住一面，

At that time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, having missed a meal and weakened by hunger, approached the Blessed One, made obeisance with her head, and stood to one side.

佛知而故問：「何故飢色？」即以是事具白世尊。

The Buddha, knowing the situation, deliberately asked, "Why do you appear so hungry?" She then explained the matter in full to the Blessed One.

佛言：「從今日後上座八人，當次第如法，餘者隨到而坐。

The Buddha said, "From this day forward, the eight senior-most should sit in order according to the rules, and the rest should sit as they arrive.

若五年大會多人集，比丘尼上座八人當次第坐，餘者隨意坐。

If a large gathering is held every five years, the eight senior-most nuns should sit in order, and the others may sit as they wish.

若八人不隨次第坐，越比尼罪。」是故世尊說。

If the eight do not sit in order, it is considered a transgression of the rules." Thus spoke the Blessed One.




二眾淨不同、
The two assemblies' purity is different,

The three are not the bhikkhu sangha,

Boundless wind and rain approach the world.

不觉手足自战栗。

Unconsciously, limbs tremble on their own.

刘郎已恨蓬山远。

Liu Lang already resents the distant Peng Mountain.

更隔蓬山几万重。

Separated by hundreds of thousands of Peng Mountains.




比丘雜跋渠中，別住、蒜、傘蓋、乘、刀治、革屣、同床臥坐、伎樂九事應出不說，餘十三跋渠殘比丘尼別。
In the various rules for monks, separate living, garlic, umbrellas, vehicles, knives, leather shoes, sharing a bed, sitting together, and nine types of performances should be described separately; the remaining thirteen rules are distinct for nuns.

五雜跋渠威儀中，阿練若、浴室、廁屋、縫衣簟應出不說，餘盡同比丘尼。
In the five miscellaneous rules concerning conduct, forest retreats, bathhouses, toilets, and embroidered mats should be separately described; the rest are the same as for nuns.

二部修多羅及學五百戒，世尊分別說戒序、八波羅夷、十九僧伽婆尸沙、三十尼薩耆波夜提、百四十一波夜提、八波羅提提舍尼、六十四眾學、七止諍法，法隨順法偈在後，比丘尼比尼竟。
In the two sections of the Vinaya and the study of the five hundred precepts, the World-Honored One details the rules: the eight Parajikas, nineteen Sanghavasesas, thirty Nissaggiya Pacittiyas, one hundred forty-one Pacittiyas, eight Patidesaniyas, sixty-four Sekhiyas, and seven Adhikarana-samatha rules, along with the related verses, concluding the nuns' Vinaya.




摩訶僧祇律私記  
The Private Notes on the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya  




，暂有恶王御世。  
In central India in ancient times, there was temporarily a wicked king ruling the kingdom.

诸沙门避之四奔，三藏比丘星离。  
The monks avoided him and scattered in all directions, and the Tripitaka monks dispersed like stars.

恶王既死，更有善王，还请诸沙门还国供养。  
Once the wicked king died, a righteous king took over and invited the monks back to the country for veneration.

时巴连弗邑有五百僧，欲断事而无律师，又无律文无所承案。  
At that time, in the city of Pataliputra, there were five hundred monks who wanted to resolve matters but had no legal teacher, nor any legal texts to work from.

即遣人到祇洹精舍，写得律本于今传赏。  
They sent someone to the Jeta Grove monastery to copy the Vinaya texts, which are now regarded with admiration.

法显于摩竭提国巴连弗邑，阿育王塔南天王精舍，写得梵本还楊州。  
Faxian, in the city of Pataliputra in Magadha country, at the Ashoka Tower's monastery of the Southern Heavenly King, copied the Sanskrit texts and returned to Yangzhou.

以晋义熙十二年岁在丙辰十一月，于斗场寺出之，至十四年二月末都讫。  
In the twelfth year of the YiXi era of Jin, in the year of Bingchen, in November, at Dou Chang Temple, the text was produced, and it was completed by the end of February in the fourteenth year.

共禅师译梵本为秦焉，故记之。  
Along with the Chan master, he translated the Sanskrit texts into Chinese for Qin, hence it is recorded here.



大迦葉集律藏為大師宗，具持八萬法藏。
After the Buddha's Nirvana, Mahakasyapa compiled the Vinaya Pitaka as the master sect, holding the eighty thousand Dharma collections.

大迦葉滅後，次尊者阿難亦具持八萬法藏，
After Mahakasyapa's demise, the venerable Ananda also held the eighty thousand Dharma collections,

次尊者末田地亦具持八萬法藏，
Then the venerable Madhyantika also held the eighty thousand Dharma collections,

次尊者舍那婆斯亦具持八萬法藏，
Then the venerable Sanakavasa also held the eighty thousand Dharma collections,

次尊者優波崛多世尊記無相佛，如降魔因緣中說，而亦能具持八萬法藏。
Then the venerable Upagupta, whom the World-Honored One predicted as the "Formless Buddha," as stated in the subduing demon conditions, was also able to hold the eighty thousand Dharma collections.

於是遂有五部名生：
Thus, there arose the names of five schools:

初曇摩崛多別為一部，
First, the Dharmaguptaka was a separate school,

次彌沙塞別為一部，
Next, the Mahīśāsaka was a separate school,

次迦葉維復為一部，
Next, the Kasyapiya was another separate school,

次薩婆多。
Next, Sarvāstivāda.

薩婆多者，晉言說一切有。
Sarvāstivāda, in Jin dynasty language, means "all exists."

所以名一切有者，自上諸部義宗各異。
The reason it is named "all exists" is that the ideological sect of each of the aforementioned schools differs.

薩婆多者，言過去、未來、現在中陰各自有性，故名一切有。
The Sarvāstivāda says that the past, future, and present intermediate states each have their own nature, hence the name "all exists."

於是五部並立紛然競起，各以自義為是。
Thus, the five schools stood together and arose in a tumult, each considering their own teachings as correct.

時阿育王言：「我今何以測其是非？」
At that time, King Ashoka said, "How can I now discern their right and wrong?"

於是問僧：「佛法斷事云何？」
He then asked the monks, "What does the Buddha Dharma say about deciding matters?"

皆言：「法應從多。」
They all replied, "The law should follow the majority."

王言：「若爾者，當行籌知何眾多。」
The king said, "If that is so, we should cast lots to know which is the majority."

於是行籌。
Thus, they cast lots.

取本眾籌者甚多，以眾多故，故名摩訶僧祇。
There were very many who took the original lot, and due to the majority, it was called Mahasanghika.

摩訶僧祇者，大眾名也。
Mahasanghika is the name of the Great Assembly.

佛說犯戒罪報輕重經
The Buddha taught the Sutra on the Light and Heavy Retribution of Breaking the Precepts.



如是我聞，一時佛住王舍城迦蘭陀竹園。
Thus I have heard, at one time the Buddha was residing in the Bamboo Grove Monastery of Kalanda, in Rajagriha.

爾時尊者目連，晡時從禪定覺，往至世尊所，頭面禮足却住一面。
Then, in the afternoon, Venerable Moggallana awoke from meditation, went to the Blessed One, paid homage by bowing his head at his feet, and stood to one side.

時尊者大目連白佛言：「世尊！意有所疑今欲請問，唯願聽許。」
At that time, Venerable Mahamoggallana spoke to the Buddha saying, "World Honored One! I have a question and I wish to ask for permission to inquire."

佛告目連：「聽汝所問，當為汝說。」
The Buddha told Moggallana, "I allow you to ask, and I will explain it to you."

目連即白佛言：「世尊！若比丘、比丘尼，無慚愧心，輕慢佛語，犯眾學戒，如是犯波羅提提舍尼、波夜提、偷蘭遮、僧伽婆尸沙、波羅夷，得幾不饒益罪？唯願解說。」
Moggallana then said to the Buddha: "World Honored One! If a monk or nun acts without a sense of shame and is disrespectful of the Buddha's words, violating various rules of training such as Parajika, Sanghadisesa, Pacittiya, and others, how serious are the resulting offenses? I wish for an explanation."

佛告目連：「諦聽！諦聽！當為汝說。若比丘、比丘尼，無慚無愧，輕慢佛語，犯眾學戒，如四天王壽五百歲墮埿梨中，於人間數九百千歲。」
The Buddha told Moggallana, "Listen carefully! Listen carefully! I will explain it to you. If a monk or nun is shameless and disrespectful of the Buddha's words, and breaks several precepts, they can fall into eras of suffering like living five hundred years as a celestial of the Four Heavenly Kings, equivalent to nine hundred thousand human years."

佛告目連：「若無慚無愧，輕慢佛語，犯波羅提提舍尼，如三十三天壽千歲墮埿梨中，於人間數三億六十千歲。」 
The Buddha told Moggallana, "If without shame, disrespecting Buddha's words, one violates Parajika, similar to living a thousand years in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, they fall into a cycle of three billion sixty thousand human years in suffering."

佛告目連：「無慚無愧，輕慢佛語，犯波夜提，如夜摩天壽二千歲墮埿梨中，於人間數二十億四十千歲。」
The Buddha told Moggallana, "Without shame, disrespecting Buddha's words, if one violates Pacittiya, like living two thousand years in the Yama Heaven, they fall into two billion forty thousand human years of suffering."

佛告目連：「無慚無愧，輕慢佛語，犯偷蘭遮，如兜率天壽四千歲墮埿梨中，於人間數五十億六十千歲。」
The Buddha told Moggallana, "With no shame, disrespecting Buddha's words, violating Pacittiya, like living four thousand years in the Tusita Heaven, they fall into fifty billion sixty thousand human years of suffering."

佛告目連：「無慚無愧，輕慢佛語，犯僧伽婆尸沙，如不憍樂天壽八千歲墮埿梨中，於人間數二百三十億四十千歲。」
The Buddha told Moggallana, "Being shameless and disrespectful, violating Sanghadisesa, akin to living in the non-prideful Heaven for eight thousand years, they fall into a span of 230 billion forty thousand human years of suffering."

佛告目連：「無慚無愧，輕慢佛語，犯波羅夷，如他化自在天壽十六千歲墮埿梨中，於人間數九百二十一億六十千歲。」
The Buddha told Moggallana, "Being without shame or respect while violating Parajika, as if living sixteen thousand years in the Heaven of the Self-created Transformations, they condemn to 921 billion sixty thousand human years of suffering."

時尊者目連聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。
Then, Venerable Moggallana, having heard what the Buddha said, rejoiced and accepted it.



爾時目連即說偈言：
At that time, Maudgalyāyana spoke in verse:

「汝本造惡因，
"You originally created evil causes,

今受地獄報；
Now you are receiving hellish retribution;

若不識善道，
If you do not recognize the path of virtue,

還來至人中。
You will return to the human realm again.

大千世界中，
In the great thousand-world system,

地獄無量所。
Hell is boundless and limitless."

汝今受苦六合間，
"You now suffer amidst the six realms,

五趣眾生業趣別。」
The five courses of sentient beings have separate destinies in karma."

聞是餓鬼言者，
"Those who hear this hungry ghost's words,

發無上道真實心。」
Will generate a true heart for the unsurpassed path."




因缘轻慢故，  
Because of contempt for conditions,

命终堕恶道；  
One will fall into the evil path after death.




因緣修善者，
Those who cultivate good karma,

於此生天上。
will be born in the heavens in this life.




緣斯修福業，  
By cultivating good karma for this reason,  

離惡得解脫；  
One can detach from evil and attain liberation.  




不善觀因緣，　　
Not understanding the conditions and causes,

身壞入惡道。」
when the body breaks, one enters an evil path."
