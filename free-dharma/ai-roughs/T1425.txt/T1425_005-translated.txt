摩訶僧祇律卷第五
The Fifth Scroll of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya




東晉天竺三藏佛陀跋陀羅共法顯譯
Translated by the Tripitaka Master Buddha-bhadra and Faxian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty from India




以戒律为指导。

Guided by precepts.

戒如同墙壁。

Precepts are like walls.

没有戒律就无以保住净土。

Without precepts, the pure land cannot be maintained.

每个持戒的人都如同一个宏伟的建筑。

Each person who upholds precepts is like a magnificent building.




佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī and explained as mentioned above.

時有比丘名尸利耶婆，於舍衛城中信家非家、捨家出家。
At that time, there was a monk named Śīrya-vā, who, in the city of Śrāvastī, left his household life, leaving the non-householder's life.

時到著入聚落衣、持鉢入城乞食，不善攝身口意，放縱諸根。
When it was time, he put on his village robes, carried his bowl, and entered the city to beg for food, not controlling his body, speech, and mind well, indulging his senses.

始入一家得食飽足已，復入第二家。
After entering one household and getting enough to eat, he went into a second house.

第二家有一女人，露身而坐。
In the second house, there was a woman sitting exposed.

是比丘見已還自住處，念彼女人身，心想馳亂、憂悴發病、顏色痿黃。
The monk saw this, returned to his dwelling, remembered the woman's body, his mind became disturbed, worried, fell ill, and his complexion became sallow.

爾時諸比丘問尸利耶婆：「汝今何故顏色痿黃憂悴不樂？欲須酥、油、石蜜、諸湯藥不？」
At that time, other monks asked Śīrya-vā, "Why is your complexion sallow, why are you worried and unhappy? Do you need ghee, oil, honey, or medicinal soup?"

答言：「不須，自當差耳。」
He replied, "No need, I will recover on my own."

諸比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷問訊亦復如是。
The nuns, laymen, and laywomen also inquired in the same way.

彼比丘於晝臥覺，心念形起，手自觸身生，即失不淨。
The monk, waking up from a nap during the day, had thoughts arise, touched his own body, and lost impurity.

失不淨已便得安樂，所患即差，便作是念：「此好方便可得除患，不妨出家淨修梵行受人信施。」
After losing impurity, he felt comfortable, his illness was cured, and he thought, "This is a good method to cure illness; it doesn’t hinder my monastic purity or receiving faith offerings."

世尊以五事利益故，五日一案行僧坊。
The World-Honored One for the benefit of five things, visited the monastery every five days.

何等為五？一者我聲聞弟子不著有為事不？
What are the five? First, my disciples should not be attached to worldly affairs.

二者不著世俗言論不？
Second, they should not be attached to worldly discussions.

三者不著睡眠妨行道不？
Third, they should not be attached to sleep that hinders the path.

四者看病比丘不？
Fourth, to see if there are any sick monks.

五者為年少新出家比丘，見如來威儀庠序起歡喜心。
Fifth, for young newly ordained monks to see the Tathāgata's graceful deportment and feel joy.

是為五事。如來五日觀歷諸房。
These are the five things. Thus, the Tathāgata inspected the various rooms every five days.

時長老尸利耶婆晝眠覺已，於自房後小行身生起。
At that time, the elder Śīrya-vā, after waking from his midday sleep, paced behind his room.

世尊畏彼尸利耶婆比丘驚怖慚愧故，世尊作小聲令其先覺。
The World-Honored One, afraid that monk Śīrya-vā might be startled and ashamed, made a soft sound to alert him beforehand.

時尸利耶婆見世尊已，疾行著衣，隨世尊後禮足而住。
When Śīrya-vā saw the World-Honored One, he quickly donned his robes, followed behind the World-Honored One, and paid respects, standing still.

爾時世尊問尸利耶婆：「汝先病患顏色痿黃，何緣得差？」
At that time, the World-Honored One asked Śīrya-vā, "Your complexion was sallow from illness before, how did you recover?"

便白佛言：「世尊！我於舍衛城中信家非家、捨家出家，親里知識給我衣服床臥醫藥不乏。
He replied to the Buddha, "World-Honored One! In the city of Śrāvastī, I left my household life, and my relatives and friends provided me with clothes, bed, and medicine.

我於一時著衣持鉢入城乞食，至一家見一女人露身而坐，見已還精舍，欲心馳亂，遂便不樂生病、不欲飲食。
One time, I put on my robes, took my bowl, entered the city to beg for food, saw a woman sitting exposed in a house, returned to the monastery, and my cravings caused distraction, leading to illness and loss of appetite.

時諸比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷來慰問我，皆欲與我醫藥。我言：『不須！』
Then, monks, nuns, male and female lay followers came to console me and offered me medicine, but I said, 'No need!'

我於一時晝日眠覺，身生起，手觸即失不淨。失不淨已得眠安隱，病得除愈。
After waking from a nap one day, I had thoughts arise, touched myself and lost impurity. After losing impurity, I slept well and recovered from my illness.

我作是念：『是好方便可得除患。不妨出家受人信施。』
I thought, 'This is a good method to cure illness, it does not hinder my receiving faith offerings as a monk.'

以是故，世尊！病得除愈，身既安隱得修梵行。」
For this reason, World-Honored One, I recovered from my illness and can practice the noble path comfortably."

佛言：「癡人！此甚不可，此非梵行而言梵行，此非安隱而言安隱。
The Buddha said, "Foolish person! This is very wrong, this is not the noble path yet you call it the noble path; this is not comfort yet you call it comfort.

癡人！云何以是手受人信施，復以此手觸失不淨。
Foolish person! How can you accept offerings from others with these hands, and then use these hands for impure acts?

汝常不聞我無量方便呵責欲想，讚歎斷欲耶？
Have you never heard in countless ways I criticize desires and praise the cessation of desires?

汝今作此惡不善事，此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以此長養善法。」
You now commit this unwholesome act, which is not according to the Dharma, nor the law, nor the Buddha's teachings, and you cannot nurture wholesome practices in this way."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城比丘皆悉令集，以十利故，為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all the monks residing in Śrāvastī, for the sake of ten benefits, I will establish a rule for the monks to hear again, even if they have heard it before.

若比丘故出精，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk deliberately releases semen, it is a Sanghadisesa offense."



衛城，廣說如上。  
Again, the Buddha was staying in Shravasti, expounding as described above.

是時長老尸利耶婆，數數犯僧伽婆尸沙、如波夜提、如波羅提提舍尼、如越比尼罪懺悔。  
At that time, Elder Shiriya repeatedly committed and repented offenses involving Sanghāvasesa, Pācittiya, Prātimokṣa Discourse, and the lesser rules.

諸比丘見尸利耶婆數數犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，乃至如越比尼罪悔過，便語尸利耶婆言：「長老！世尊已作制限分齊竟，汝云何輕為數數犯耶？」  
The monks saw Shiriya repeatedly committing Sanghāvasesa offenses and sinning up to lesser ones and said to him, "Elder! The World-Honored One has already established restrictions and boundaries. How can you lightly repeat these offenses?"

尸利耶婆言：「諸長老！我犯罪悔過，尚不厭倦。汝等受我悔過，何足為難？」  
Shiriya replied, "Elders! I commit and repent offenses without growing tired. How difficult is it for you to accept my repentance?"

諸比丘以是事具白世尊，佛言：「喚尸利耶婆來。」  
The monks presented this matter in full to the World-Honored One, and the Buddha said, "Call Shiriya here."

來已，佛問尸利耶婆：「汝實數數犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，乃至語諸比丘言：『我犯罪悔過尚不厭倦，汝等受我懺悔何足為難也？』」  
When he came, the Buddha asked Shiriya, "Did you indeed repeatedly commit Sanghāvasesa offenses and say to the monks, 'I commit offenses and repent without growing weary. How hard is it for you to accept my repentance?'"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」  
He answered, "Indeed, World-Honored One!"

佛告尸利耶婆：「此是惡事，從今日後，若犯僧伽婆尸沙罪者，應六日六夜比丘僧中行摩那埵。行摩那埵已，應二十比丘僧中出罪。」  
The Buddha told Shiriya, "This is an evil deed. From today onwards, whoever commits a Sanghāvasesa offense must practice Manatta among the monks for six days and six nights. After practicing Manatta, they should be absolved of offenses among twenty monks."  




復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Then the Buddha resided in Śrāvastī and gave a wide discourse as above.

時尸利耶婆數數犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，便作是念：
At that time, Śrīya Pa repeatedly committed a serious offense, and thought to himself:

「世尊制戒，犯僧伽婆尸沙罪者，應六日六夜行摩那埵。
"The Blessed One established the precept that one who commits a serious offense should practice repentance for six days and nights.

行摩那埵已，應二十比丘僧中出罪。
After practicing repentance, one should confess the offense before a community of twenty monks.

我今已犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，人不知者則無六日六夜；
I have committed a serious offense, but if no one knows, then there is no need for six days and nights of repentance;

無六日六夜者，亦無二十僧中出罪。
Without the six days and nights, there is also no need to confess before twenty monks.

我今當覆藏。」
I will conceal it now."

覆藏已便自疑悔：
After concealing it, he immediately doubted and regretted:

「我為不善，甚不如法，善男子信心出家，知佛制戒而故違覆藏。
"I have acted improperly, against the Dharma, like a good man who leaves home with faith but knows the Buddha's precepts and yet deliberately violates and conceals them.

設梵行人不知者，諸天知他人心者豈不知耶？
Even if practitioners do not know, would not the celestial beings who know people's minds be aware?

設諸天不知者，世尊豈當不知耶？」
And if the celestial beings are unaware, how could the Blessed One not know?"

便語諸比丘：「與我摩那埵。」
He then said to the other monks, "Give me the opportunity to repent."

比丘問言：「何以求摩那埵？」
The monks asked, "Why do you seek to repent?"

答言：「我犯僧伽婆尸沙罪。」
He replied, "I have committed a serious offense."

復問：「犯來幾時？」
They further asked, "How long has it been since you committed it?"

答言：「爾許時。」
He replied, "It's been this long."

復問：「何不即語人耶？」
They asked again, "Why didn't you speak immediately?"

答言：「我慚羞故不即說，我復念言：
He replied, "I was ashamed and thus did not speak immediately. I thought again:

『犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，世尊制戒應六日六夜行摩那埵。
'The Blessed One established the rule that committing a serious offense requires six days and nights of repentance.'

乃至言：『諸天不知者，世尊豈不知耶？』
Even saying: 'If the celestial beings do not know, how could the Blessed One not know?'

以是事故，今向長老說。」
For this reason, I speak now to the elder."

諸比丘以是事具白世尊，
The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One.

佛言：「喚尸利耶婆來。」
The Buddha said, "Call Śrīya Pa here."

來已，佛具問上事：「汝實爾不？」
When he came, the Buddha asked about the matter in detail: "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
He replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「癡人！此是惡事，
The Buddha said, "Foolish person! This is a wicked deed,

犯戒尚不慚羞悔過，何以慚羞？」
violating the precept without feeling shame and remorse, why feel ashamed?"

爾時世尊即說偈言：
At that time, the Blessed One then spoke a verse:



覆盖者则漏，  
Those who are covered will leak;

开者则不漏；  
Those who are open will not leak;




是故諸覆者，
Therefore, to all who are covered,

當開令不漏。
they must open it to prevent any leakage.




佛告諸比丘：「從今日犯僧伽婆尸沙罪覆藏者，應與波利婆沙。
The Buddha told the monks: "From today, those who hide the offense of Sanghādisesa should be given Pārājika.

行波利婆沙已，當與六日六夜行摩那埵。
After performing Pārājika, they should undergo six days and nights of Mānatta.

六日六夜行摩那埵已，當應二十僧中出罪。
After six days and nights of Mānatta, they should have their offense absolved in the presence of twenty monks.

二十僧中少一比丘欲出罪者，是比丘不得出罪，諸比丘應可訶。」
If there is even one monk short among the twenty, the monk wishing to be absolved cannot be; the monks should reproach him.




衛城，廣說如上。

Furthermore, the Buddha resided in the city of Shravasti and spoke extensively as before.

時有二學人、二凡夫人夢中出精，彼各各思惟：

At that time, two learners and two ordinary people experienced emissions in their dreams and each thought:

「世尊制戒故出精者，犯僧伽婆尸沙罪。

"The Blessed One has established a precept that those who emit knowingly commit a Sanghadisesa offense.

我今將不犯僧伽婆尸沙耶？

Have I now committed a Sanghadisesa offense?

當以是事具白尊者舍利弗，舍利弗當問世尊，若佛有教我當奉行。」

I shall report this matter to the Venerable Sariputra, and Sariputra will ask the Blessed One. If the Buddha instructs, I will follow."

是諸比丘便詣尊者舍利弗所，以是因緣白舍利弗。

These monks then went to Venerable Sariputra and reported the matter due to this reason.

時舍利弗將是比丘詣世尊所，尊者舍利弗白佛言：

At that time, Sariputra brought these monks to the Blessed One and Venerable Sariputra addressed the Buddha:

「此四比丘夢中失精，便自疑悔：

"These four monks experienced emissions in their dreams and are now in doubt and remorse:

『世尊制戒，我將不犯僧伽婆尸沙罪耶？』故來白佛。世尊！是事云何？」

'The Blessed One has established a precept; have I committed a Sanghadisesa offense?' Therefore, they have come to report to the Buddha. Blessed One, how is this matter?"

佛告舍利弗：「夢者虛妄不實，若夢真實，於我法中修梵行者，無有解脫。

The Buddha told Sariputra: "Dreams are deceptive and unreal. If dreams were real, those who cultivate the holy life in my teaching would not attain liberation.

以一切夢皆不真實，是故舍利弗！諸修梵行者，於我法中得盡苦際。」

Since all dreams are not real, therefore, Sariputra, those who cultivate the holy life in my teaching reach the end of suffering."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城比丘皆悉令集，以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。

The Buddha told the monks: "Gather all the monks residing in the city of Shravasti. For ten benefits, I have established precepts for the monks, so that those who have heard may hear again.

若比丘故出精，除夢中，僧伽婆尸沙罪。」

If a monk emits knowingly, except in a dream, it is a Sanghadisesa offense."




故者，心調方便也。
Therefore, harmony of the mind is the way to adaptability.




出精者，出不淨也。
The one who expels essence expels impurity.




除夢中者，世尊說夢中失精無罪。
Except in dreams, the World-Honored One said that there is no sin in losing essence in dreams.




僧伽婆尸沙者，僧伽，謂四波羅夷；
The term "Saṃghāvaśeṣa" refers to the saṃgha, meaning the four pārājikas;

婆尸沙者，是罪有餘，應羯磨治，故說僧伽婆尸沙。
Vaśeṣa means remaining offenses that should be addressed through administrative actions; thus, it is called Saṃghāvaśeṣa.

復次是罪僧中發露悔過，亦名僧伽婆尸沙。
Moreover, these are offenses revealed and repented for within the saṃgha, also named Saṃghāvaśeṣa.




夢者，有五種：何等五？

Dreams are of five kinds: what are the five?

一者實夢；二者不實夢；三者不明了夢；四者夢中夢；五者先想而後夢，是為五。

First, true dreams; second, false dreams; third, unclear dreams; fourth, dreams within dreams; fifth, dreams preceded by thoughts. These are the five.

何者實夢？

What is a true dream?

所謂如來為菩薩時，見五種夢如實不異，是名實夢。

It is said that when the Tathagata was a Bodhisattva, he saw five kinds of dreams as they truly were, unchanged. This is called a true dream.

不實夢者，若人見夢，覺不實，是名不實夢。

A false dream is when someone sees a dream, and upon awakening perceives it to be false. This is called a false dream.

不明了夢者，如其夢不記前後中間，是謂不明了夢。

An unclear dream is when the content of the dream, such as before, during, and after, is not remembered. This is called an unclear dream.

夢中夢者，如見夢即於夢中為人說夢，是名夢中夢。

A dream within a dream is when one sees a dream and within that dream, tells someone else about the dream. This is called a dream within a dream.

先想而後夢者，如晝所作想夜便輒夢，是名先想後夢。

A dream preceded by thoughts is when thoughts conceived during the day manifest as dreams at night. This is called a dream preceded by thoughts.



有五事因緣起於婬欲：眼見色，染著愛樂，生婬欲想；
There are five conditions that arise from sensual desire: seeing forms with the eye, becoming attracted and delighted, giving rise to sensual thoughts;

如眼見色染著者，耳、鼻、舌、身亦如是，
Just as seeing forms with the eyes leads to attachment, so does hearing sounds, smelling scents, tasting flavors, and feeling touches with the body;

先與女人情相娛樂，後續憶念即生婬欲心，
First, there is emotional engagement and pleasure with women, followed by recollection which then gives rise to a mind of sensual desire;

是名五種因緣起婬欲。
This is called the five conditions that give rise to sensual desire.



身生起有五事因緣
There are five causes and conditions for the arising of the body:

欲心起
The arising of desire heart,

大行起
The arising of great activity,

小行起
The arising of small activity,

風患起
The arising of wind trouble,

若非人觸起
And the arising of non-human touch,

是為五事因緣起
These are the five causes and conditions for arising.



弄出精有三事：有欲心、故弄、出。
There are three things about emission: desire, deliberate action, and release.

弄出者，為取精故、為樂故。
Emission is for the sake of obtaining essence or for pleasure.

若自念言：「久來不通脫生諸患，欲令通故。」
If one thinks: "For a long time, various issues have arisen due to blockage, I wish to clear it."

若戲故、若自試故、若未曾故、或自弄出、若使人弄出，是為弄出精者。
Whether for fun, self-testing, previously unexperienced, self-caused emission, or caused by another, this is emission.

若酥色、油色、乳色、酪色，若青、黃、赤、白，如是種種色，若一一色出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If it is the color of ghee, oil, milk, cream, or any such color like green, yellow, red, or white, it's a Sanghhadisesa offense.

欲心起身生，有出想，而不弄不出，是為心悔過。
If desire arises in the body, with the thought of emission, but there is no deliberate action and no emission, it is repentance of the mind.

若欲心起身生，有出想，故弄而不出，得偷蘭罪。
If desire arises in the body with the thought of emission, deliberate action is taken but there is no emission, it is a Thullaccaya offense.

欲心起身生，有出想，故弄而出，得僧伽婆尸沙。
If desire arises in the body with the thought of emission, deliberate action is taken and there is emission, it is a Sanghhadisesa offense.

若欲心起身生，無出想，不故弄，出，無罪。
If desire arises in the body without the thought of emission, and there is no deliberate action, yet emission occurs, there is no offense.

如是大行、小行、風患、非人起亦如是。
So it is with major or minor transgressions, disorders of wind, or caused by non-humans.

若欲心起身生，有出想，故弄精欲出，而不出外者，偷蘭罪。
If desire arises with the thought of emission, deliberate action is taken for emission but it does not exit externally, it is a Thullaccaya offense.

若欲心起身生，有出想，不弄不出，當責心。
If desire arises with the thought of emission, but there's no action and no emission, one should reprimand the mind.

若欲心起身生，無出想，弄而不出，是亦責心。
If desire arises without the thought of emission, action is taken but there's no emission, still one should reprimand the mind.

若欲心起身生，無出想，不故弄出，是亦責心。
If desire arises without the thought of emission, yet without deliberate action there is emission, one should still reprimand the mind.

若欲心起身生，有出想，故弄而出，得僧伽婆尸沙。
If desire arises with the thought of emission, deliberate action is taken and emission occurs, it is a Sanghhadisesa offense.

乃至非人亦復如是。
Even for non-human beings, it's the same.



出精者，若身、若身分、若身合身者，一切身動跳擲，時作方便而出，出者僧伽婆尸沙。
Those who ejaculate, whether through the body, a part of the body, or bodily contact, using any means to stimulate and ejaculate, commit an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

身分者，若以手、若以脚、若膊、若以肘作方便出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
Parts of the body refer to using the hand, foot, shoulder, or elbow to stimulate and ejaculate, which is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

身合者，地、水、火、風。
Bodily contact includes earth, water, fire, and wind.

地者，若床、若褥、若壁孔、木孔、竹筒等，若一一堅物觸身欲令出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
Earth refers to using beds, mattresses, wall holes, wood holes, bamboo tubes, etc., to touch the body for stimulation and ejaculation, resulting in an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

水者，諸流水逆觸身，酥油等如是諸水物中濕潤物，身觸欲令出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
Water refers to all kinds of flowing water touching the body, or using greasy materials like oil, to stimulate and ejaculate, which is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

火者，若於諸暖處暖具身觸、若向火向日欲令出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
Fire refers to using warm places or objects to touch the body, or facing fire or the sun to stimulate and ejaculate, resulting in an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

風者，若口風、若扇風、若衣風，觸身欲令出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
Wind refers to using breath, fan, or clothes wind to touch the body for stimulation and ejaculation, which is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若比丘語人言：「汝弄我身生令出。」精出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk tells someone "stimulate my body to ejaculate," and ejaculation occurs, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若復語人言：「汝莫令我數語，汝常知是事。」而後弄出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk further tells someone to silently understand and stimulate him, and ejaculation occurs, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若比丘在空閑處住，見有禽獸交會，見已欲心起，失不淨者，是應責心。
If a monk stays in a secluded place, sees animals mating, and feels a desire leading to a loss of purity, he should feel reproached.

若復為受樂故，更方便逐看禽獸欲令出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If he deliberately watches animals mating for pleasure and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若有人強力，捉比丘弄令出者，是應責心；若為樂故，更就彼人令弄，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If someone forcibly stimulates a monk and ejaculation occurs, the monk should feel reproached; if he agrees for pleasure and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若比丘入聚落，見他男女行婬，見已欲心起失不淨者，是應責心；若復為樂故，更逐往看令失者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk enters a settlement and sees people engaging in sexual acts, feels desire and loses purity, he should feel reproached; if he watches for pleasure and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若比丘見男子造婬女家，便作是念：「此中更無餘事，正當作婬欲。」而自欲心起失不淨者，是應責心；為樂故，更往看令失者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk sees a man visiting a prostitute and thinks "there's nothing else here but sexual acts," feels desire and loses purity, he should feel reproached; if he goes to watch for pleasure and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若比丘見女人裸身洗浴，見已欲心起失不淨者，是應責心；若為樂故，逐往看令出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk sees a woman bathing naked and feels desire leading to a loss of purity, he should feel reproached; if he watches for pleasure and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

若見男子裸身亦復如是。
If he sees a man naked, the same rules apply.

若比丘行道中欲心自起而失不淨者，是應責心；行時故作方便令出，出者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk feels desire and loses purity while walking on a path, he should feel reproached; if he deliberately stimulates himself while walking and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

如行，住坐臥亦如是。
The same applies while standing, sitting, or lying down.

若因塗油洗浴失者，是應責心；若故作方便，塗油洗浴令失者，僧伽婆尸沙。
If a monk loses purity while oiling or bathing, he should feel reproached; if he deliberately stimulates himself through oiling or bathing and ejaculates, it is an offense of Sanghabasisasa.

是故世尊說：「故弄失精，除夢中，僧伽婆尸沙。」(一戒竟)
Thus the Blessed One said: "Deliberate stimulation leading to ejaculation, except in dreams, is an offense of Sanghabasisasa." (End of one rule)



迦蘭陀竹園，廣說如上。

The Buddha resided at Bamboo Grove Monastery in Rajagaha, as elaborated above.

時優鉢羅比丘尼、有沙彌尼字支梨。

At that time, the nun Ubhariya had a novice named Chiri.

優鉢羅比丘尼遣沙彌尼支梨持衣與優陀夷。

The nun Ubhariya sent the novice Chiri with a robe to give to Yudayi.

時優陀夷於自房前縫衣，支梨禮優陀夷足於前而住，白優陀夷言：「我師優鉢羅，遣我持衣與長老！」

At that moment, Yudayi was in front of his room sewing a robe, and Chiri bowed at Yudayi's feet and said, "My teacher Ubhariya sent me with a robe for the elder!"

答言：「好持著房中。」

He replied, "Good, place it in the room."

時優陀夷尋後逐入房內，便手把持抱，適意已須臾放去。

Then Yudayi followed her into the room, grasped and held her, and, after achieving satisfaction, released her shortly after.

支梨行涕還師，優鉢羅問言：「汝何以涕？」

Chiri returned to her teacher in tears, and Ubhariya asked, "Why are you crying?"

答言：「長老優陀夷，隨我入房把持抱弄，極惱觸我。」

She replied, "The elder Yudayi followed me into the room, groped and fondled me, which greatly upset and disturbed me."

優鉢羅言：「汝莫涕也，我當白佛令罰優陀夷。」

Ubhariya said, "Do not cry; I shall report this to the Buddha for Yudayi to be punished.


復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Furthermore, the Buddha stayed in the city of Shravasti and explained extensively as above.

長老優陀夷，時到著入聚落衣持鉢，入城次行乞食。
Elder Udayin, at that time, put on his village attire, carried a bowl, and went into the city to beg for food.

入一家見一女人磨豆，便捉髮編舉案牽推，手捉抱弄，適意已須臾放去。
Entering a house, he saw a woman grinding beans, then grabbed her hair, lifted her, pulled and pushed, held, embraced, and played with her, and shortly thereafter let her go.

彼便嫌責言：「此非法、非善。」
She complained and said, "This is neither lawful nor good."

優陀夷！汝呼我家是婬女家耶？
Udayin! Are you calling my family a house of prostitutes?

當以是事白諸比丘。」
I will report this matter to the other monks."

優陀夷言：「白與不白當隨汝意。」
Udayin said, "To report or not to report is up to you."

便出而去。
Then he left and went away.




復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。  
Furthermore, the Buddha resided in the city of Śrāvastī, elaborating as above.  

時優陀夷，時到著入聚落衣持鉢，入城次行乞食。  
At that time, Udayin donned his robes and took his bowl to enter the city to beg for food.  

入一家，時有妊娠女人，舂極坐臼上息。  
Entering a house, there was a pregnant woman resting on a large mortar.  

時優陀夷脚蹴臼，臼轉母人倒地身形裸露。  
When Udayin kicked the mortar, it spun, causing the woman to fall down and her body to be exposed.  

優陀夷即便扶起言：「姊妹起，我已見竟。」  
Udayin immediately helped her up, saying, "Sister, rise, I have already seen."  

時女人瞋恚言：「沙門釋子，此非是辭謝法，我寧受汝舂杵打死，不欲令此覆藏處出現於人。  
The woman angrily said, "Monk, son of the Śākya, this is not a way to express apologies. I would rather be beaten to death by your pestle than have my private parts exposed to others.  

我當以是事白諸比丘。」  
I will report this matter to the monks."  

優陀夷言：「白與不白自隨汝意。」言已便去。  
Udayin replied, "Whether you report or not is up to you," and then left.  




復次佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Again, the Buddha was residing in the city of Śrāvastī, and he expounded as above.

時長老優陀夷直次守房，時優陀夷先有一知識婆羅門，將婦來詣優陀夷，其婦端正。
At that time, Elder Uttara was guarding the room in turn. Uttara had a Brahmin friend who brought his beautiful wife to visit him.

夫語優陀夷言：「可開諸房示此婦人。」
The husband said to Uttara, "Please open the rooms and show them to my wife."

優陀夷言：「汝若不語，我亦欲示此婦人房舍，況復汝請！」
Uttara said, "Even if you hadn't asked, I would have wanted to show the rooms to your wife—let alone now that you've requested it!"

即將至閣上示諸房舍，彫文刻鏤種種嚴飾，地作青豆色。
So, they went up to the pavilion where Uttara showed her the rooms, adorned with various carvings and decorations, with floors resembling green beans.

於一屏處，便捉婦人手把持抱，婦人念言：「此優陀夷必欲作如是如是事。」
At a screened spot, he took the woman's hand and embraced her, and the woman thought, "This Uttara surely wishes to do such and such."

弄已還放，語婆羅門言：「我已示竟。」
After playing with her, he released her and said to the Brahmin, "I've shown everything."

婆羅門言：「好！更可示餘房舍。」
The Brahmin said, "Good! Please show the other rooms as well."

時彼婦以優陀夷不共行欲故，便瞋恚言：「用看房舍為？此是薄福黃門出家，遍摩觸我身而無好事。」
Then the woman, because Uttara didn't fulfill his desires with her, angrily said, "What's the use in seeing the rooms? He's an impotent mendicant fondling my entire body for no good reason."

時婆羅門語優陀夷言：「汝實於我知識而生非知識想耶？而於平地更生堆埠耶？而於水中更生火也？」
The Brahmin then said to Uttara, "Did you truly conceive of me, your friend, as something other than that? Did you raise a mound in a flat place, or set fire to water?"

即便繫優陀夷頸牽去。
With that, he bound Uttara's neck and dragged him away.

優陀夷言：「婆羅門放我，莫使須臾作破頭事。」
Uttara said, "Brahmin, release me. Don't let a moment’s anger lead to harm."

婆羅門言：「我不放汝，汝有負我事。」
The Brahmin said, "I will not release you. You have wronged me."

諸比丘聞鬪諍聲出看，語婆羅門言：「置置，放優陀夷！」
The monks, hearing the commotion, came out to look and said to the Brahmin, "Stop, stop! Release Uttara!"

婆羅門言：「我終不放，要將詣世尊！」 
The Brahmin said, "I will never release him. I will take him to the Blessed One!"

時佛見已，語婆羅門言：「放優陀夷！」
When the Buddha saw this, he said to the Brahmin, "Release Uttara!"

婆羅門白佛言：「世尊！我今不放，要當說其罪狀然後放去。」
The Brahmin addressed the Buddha, "Blessed One, I will not release him now. I first want to mention his transgressions, then release him."

時優陀夷便力諍，得脫走去。
At that moment, Uttara struggled hard and managed to escape.

時婆羅門以上因緣具白世尊。
The Brahmin then fully explained the incident to the Blessed One. 

爾時世尊為婆羅門隨順說法示教利喜，瞋恚即除得法眼淨，辭還請退。
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Brahmin in accordance with the Dharma, instructing and encouraging him until his anger dissipated, and he attained the pure Dharma Eye. He then respectfully took his leave. 

佛言：「宜知是時。」即禮佛足右遶三匝而去。
The Buddha said, "Know that this is the right time." Then he circumambulated the Buddha three times and left. 

婆羅門去不久，佛告諸比丘：「喚優陀夷來。」
Not long after the Brahmin left, the Buddha said to the monks, "Call Uttara here."

即喚來已，佛以上事廣問優陀夷：「汝實爾不？」
After being summoned, the Buddha thoroughly questioned Uttara about the incident, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
He replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「優陀夷！此是惡事。」
The Buddha said, "Uttara! This is an evil deed."

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！此優陀夷不但作此一惡事。
The monks said to the Buddha, "Blessed One, Uttara did not commit just this one evil deed.

先時世尊在王舍城迦蘭陀竹園時，優鉢羅比丘尼遣沙彌尼支梨持衣與優陀夷，優陀夷便捉抱弄，適意已放去。」
Previously, when the Blessed One was in Rājagṛha, at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove, Uppalavannā Bhikṣuṇī sent the novice Saṁghāni with a robe for Uttara. Uttara grabbed, embraced, and played until satisfied, then let her go."

佛問優陀夷：「有是事不？」
The Buddha asked Uttara, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
He replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「此是惡事。」
The Buddha said, "This is an evil deed."

復有比丘白佛言：「不但作此惡事。
Another monk said to the Buddha, "It's not just this evil deed.

世尊在舍衛城時，優陀夷時到著入聚落衣持鉢，次行乞食。
When the Blessed One was in Śrāvastī, Uttara would wear the village-roaming garb and carry his alms bowl, going to beg for food.

入一家，家中有一女人磨豆。時優陀夷便捉其髮編，抱捉惱弄放去。」
Upon entering a house where a woman was grinding beans, Uttara grabbed her hair braid, embraced and teased her, then let her go."

佛問優陀夷：「實有是事不？」
The Buddha asked Uttara, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
He replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「此是惡事。」
The Buddha said, "This is an evil deed."

復有比丘言：「世尊！何但有此惡事，
Another monk said, "Blessed One, not only is there this evil deed,

又復一時世尊在舍衛城時，優陀夷著入聚落衣持鉢乞食入一家。
Additionally, when the Blessed One was in Śrāvastī, Uttara went into the village wearing the alms attire, carrying his bowl, and entered a house.

有一妊娠女人舂極坐臼上息，優陀夷以脚蹴臼令其倒地，觀其形體然後出去。」
There was a pregnant woman resting while pounding grain. Uttara kicked the mortar, causing her to fall, and observed her body before leaving."

佛言：「優陀夷！汝復有是事不？」
The Buddha said, "Uttara, did you do this as well?"

答言：「實爾世尊！」
He replied, "It is true, Blessed One!"

佛言：「何以故爾？」
The Buddha asked, "Why did you do such a thing?"

答言：「世尊！我未曾見妊娠女形，故試看耳！」
He replied, "Blessed One, I had never seen the form of a pregnant woman, so I wanted to check it out."

佛言：「癡人！寧觀糞廁，不觀彼妊娠女形。
The Buddha said, "Foolish man! You prefer to look at a toilet than view the form of a pregnant woman.

我常不種種呵責欲想，讚歎離欲耶？
Do I not always criticize lustful thoughts and commend the rejection of desires?

汝云何作此惡不善行？此非法、非律、非如佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
How could you commit such an evil act? This is not the Dharma, not the discipline, not the Buddha's teaching, and cannot cultivate good Dharma."




諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！云何是優陀夷，為婆羅門所捉，蒙世尊恩故得脫？」

The monks addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One! How did Udāyin, captured by a Brahmin, get free thanks to your grace?"

佛告諸比丘：「是優陀夷不但今日蒙我得脫，過去世時以曾被捉，蒙我得脫。」

The Buddha told the monks: "This Udāyin was not only saved by me today, but also in a past life when he was captured, I helped him escape."

諸比丘白佛言：「已曾爾耶？」

The monks said to the Buddha: "Was it really so?"

佛言：「如是！過去世時香山中有仙人住處，去山不遠有一池水。

The Buddha said: "Indeed! In a past life, there was a habitat of an ascetic in the Gandhamādana Mountain, and not far from the mountain was a pond.

時池水中有一鼈，出池求食，食已向日張口而眠。

At that time, there was a turtle in the pond, which came out to seek food and then, after eating, would open its mouth sleepily under the sun.

時香山中有諸獼猴，入池飲水已上岸，見此鼈張口而眠。

Then some monkeys from the Gandhamādana Mountain came to drink water from the pond and saw the turtle sleeping with its mouth open.

時彼獼猴便欲作婬法，即以身生內鼈口中。

One of the monkeys wanted to engage in indecent conduct and placed its body inside the turtle's mouth.

鼈覺合口藏六甲裏。如所說偈言：

The turtle woke up, closed its mouth, and held the monkey in its armor, as stated in the verse.



愚癡人執相，　
Ignorant people cling to appearances,  

猶如鼈所咬；
Like a turtle's bite;




失修摩羅捉，  
If it's not repaired, the Mora seized,

非斧則不離。  
It cannot be separated without an axe.




時鼈急捉獼猴却行欲入水,

At that time, the turtle hurriedly grabbed the monkey and started to get into the water.

獼猴急怖便作是念：『若我入水必死無疑。』

The monkey, terrified, thought, 'If I enter the water, I will surely die.'

然苦痛力弱，任鼈迴轉，流離牽曳遇值嶮處。

In pain and weak, it let the turtle carry it around, wandering and pulling towards a dangerous place.

鼈時仰臥，是時獼猴兩手抱鼈，作是念言：

The turtle lay on its back, and at that time the monkey held onto the turtle with both hands, thinking,

『誰當為我脫此苦難？』

'Who will save me from this suffering?'

獼猴曾知仙人住處，『彼當救我。』

The monkey had known of the place where a sage lived, 'He will save me.'

便抱此鼈向彼處去。

Then it held the turtle and headed towards that place.

仙人遙見便作是念：

The sage saw from afar and thought,

『咄哉異事。今是獼猴為作何等？』

'Wow, what a strange thing. What is this monkey trying to do now?'

欲戲弄獼猴故，言：

Wanting to play a trick on the monkey, he said,

『婆羅門！是何等寶物滿鉢持來？

'Brahmin! What kind of treasure are you carrying in a full pot?

得何等信而來向我。』

What kind of confidence makes you come to me?'

爾時獼猴即說偈言：

At that time, the monkey recited a verse:




『我愚癡獼猴，
I, the foolish monkey,

無辜觸惱他；
innocently annoyed him;




救厄者賢士，  
The savior is a wise man,  

命急在不久。  
Fate is urgent and won't last long.  




今日婆罗门，  
Today the Brahmins,  

若不救我者；  
If you do not save me;  




須臾斷身生，　　
In a moment, one can sever the living self,

困厄還山林。
In distress, one returns to the mountain forest.




爾者之言今如是。
Your words now are like this.

雲起初晴收覺露，
When the clouds rise at the beginning of a clear day, the dew gathers.

幽谷清寒榮不華。
In the secluded valley, it's cold and clear but not extravagant.

石泉淙淙流細響，
The stone spring flows gently with a subtle sound.

澗中獨步意無涯。
Walking alone in the stream, the mind is limitless.

千巖萬壑無人至，
Thousands of cliffs and ravines, where no one reaches,

獨立蒼茫何所期。
Standing alone in the vastness, what else is expected?



「『我令汝得脫，

"I let you escape,

還於山林中；

and return to the mountains and forests;




恐汝獼猴法，
I fear your deceitful ways,

故態還復生。
and that your old habits will return.




爾時彼仙人，　　
At that time, the sage,

為說往昔事：
explained the events of the past:




鼈汝宿命時，
In a previous life, you were a turtle.

曾號字迦葉；
You were once named Kasyapa.




獼猴過去世，　　
In past lives, the monkey,

號字憍陳如。
was named Kaundinya.




汝作婬欲行，
Your lustful ways,

今可斷因緣，
Can now sever the karma,




迦葉放憍陳，
Kassapa released Kautilya,

令還山林去。
ordering him to return to the mountains and forests.



佛告諸比丘：「爾時仙人豈異人乎？

The Buddha said to the monks, "Was the sage at that time a different person?

即我身是。

That was me.

鼈者，婆羅門是。

The turtle was the Brahmin.

是時獼猴者，優陀夷是。

The monkey at that time was Upatissa.

本為獸時蒙我得脫，

Originally, when he was an animal, he was saved by me.

今復蒙我重得解脫。」

Now he is once again liberated by me."



諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！云何是優陀夷於支梨沙彌尼如女乃起欲想？」

The monks said to Buddha, "World Honored One! How is it that Udāyin has arose lustful thoughts towards the nun Sundarī?"

佛告諸比丘：「不但今日是優陀夷於支梨如女而起欲想，過去世時已曾於是女起婬欲想。」

The Buddha told the monks, "Not only today does Udāyin have lustful thoughts towards Sundarī, but even in past lives, he had such lustful thoughts towards this woman."

諸比丘白佛言：「世尊！已曾爾耶？」

The monks said to Buddha, "World Honored One! Was it really so?"

佛言：「如是！過去世時有婆羅門，姓嵩渠氏，田作生活。

The Buddha said, "Yes! In a past life there was a Brahmin, of the Sungkur clan, making a living through farming.

索得一婦，端正姝好共相娛樂，便生一女亦復端正。

He acquired a wife, beautiful and graceful, and they enjoyed each other's company, and they had a daughter who was also beautiful.

為作名字，以嵩渠姓故，字為嵩渠。

They named her, and because of the Sungkur family name, she was called Sungkur.

至年長大，諸種種姓婆羅門遣信來索。

As she grew up, various Brahmins from different clans sent proposals.

時女問母：『此何客來？』

The girl asked her mother, "Who are these guests coming for?"

答言：『索汝。』

The mother replied, "They are here to propose to you."

其女白母：『我不欲嫁，樂修梵行。』

The daughter said to her mother, "I do not wish to marry; I delight in practicing celibate conduct."

母言：『不爾，男女之法要有嫁娶。』

The mother said, "No, the custom for men and women is to marry."

女復白言：『若父母見愛念者，願莫嫁我。』

The girl replied, "If my parents love and care for me, please do not marry me off."

時父母愛女故，不能苦違，答言：『任意。』

At that time, because the parents loved their daughter, they could not bear to oppose her and said, "As you wish."

時隣里知識皆悉知之：『云何是女端正姝好，而能守志樂修梵行？』

At that time, everyone in the neighborhood knew, "How is it that such a beautiful girl can steadfastly delight in practicing celibate conduct?"

皆愛念之。

Everyone loved and admired her.

時婆羅門入田耕作，婦常送食。

At that time, the Brahmin went to the field to work, and the wife always sent food.

遇於一時其婦有事，遣女嵩渠送食與父。

Once, his wife had something to attend to and sent their daughter Sungkur to take food to her father.

時婆羅門不正思惟便生欲想，憶念婦至當共行欲，見持食來，便捨犁往迎。

At that time, the Brahmin, not thinking correctly, gave rise to lustful thoughts, remembering the past with his wife, and seeing the daughter bringing food, he put down his plow and went to meet her.

欲心迷醉不能自覺，不應觸處父輒觸之。

His lustful mind deluded him beyond awareness, and he touched her inappropriately as a father should not.

時女嵩渠便涕泣而住，時婆羅門即便念言：

At that moment, the girl Sungkur stood still weeping, and the Brahmin immediately thought:

『此女嵩渠常不樂欲，眾人所歎。今我觸之而不大喚，似有欲意。』

"This girl Sungkur is always known for not delighting in lust, praised by all. Now that I have touched her and she didn't cry out loudly, it seems she has lustful intent."

即說偈言：

He then spoke a verse:



「現在我觸摸你的身體，　  
Now I touch your body,

低下頭長長歎息；  
Bow my head and sigh deeply;




將不欲與我，  
She will not desire to be with me,  

共行婬欲法。  
to jointly engage in the practice of lust.  




汝先修梵行，
First, cultivate pure conduct;

眾人之所敬；
Which is respected by all people;




而今软相现，
Now the gentle appearance emerges,

似有世间意。
As if holding the intentions of the world.




爾時嵩渠女以偈，答父言：
At that time, the girl of Song Fu answered her father with a verse:




我先恐怖時，

When I was first afraid,

仰憑於慈父；

I looked up and relied on the merciful father;




本所依怙處，
The place of reliance,

更遭斯惱亂。
Encountered further turmoil.




今在深榛中，
Now in the deep thicket,

知復何所告！
Who knows what to reveal?



如同在深水中，    
Like being in deep water,    

而又从火中重生。    
And reborn from the fire.    




根本蔭覆處，　　
The place of fundamental shelter,

而今恐怖生；
Now gives rise to fear;




無畏處生畏，
In places without fear, fear arises.

所歸反遭難。
Where one seeks refuge, adversity is met.




林樹諸天神，  
The myriad forest trees and celestial beings,  

證知此非法；  
Bear witness that this is against the law;  




不終生養恩，  
The kindness of raising me for life is not repaid,

一朝見困辱。  
One morning I see distress and humiliation.  




地不為我開，
The earth does not open for me,

於何逃身命？
How can I escape with my life?



女說頌，大自慚愧即便而去。

When the Brahmin heard the girl's verses, he felt greatly ashamed and immediately left.

佛告諸比丘：「爾時婆羅門者豈異人乎？今優陀夷是。

The Buddha told the monks: "Was the Brahmin at that time any different person? He is now Udāyin.

時婆羅門婦者，今優鉢羅比丘尼是。

The Brahmin's wife at that time is now the nun Uppalavannā.

時女嵩渠者，今支梨沙彌尼是。

The girl Sukkā at that time is now the novice nun Cira.

本已曾於此女生欲想故，今續復起。」

Previously he had already generated lustful thoughts towards this girl, and now they arise again."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城住者皆悉令集。

The Buddha told the monks: "Everyone dwelling in the city of Śrāvastī should gather.

以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。

For ten benefits, I establish a rule for the monks, so that even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘婬欲變心，與女人身相摩觸，

If a monk's mind changes to desire and makes physical contact with a woman,

若捉手、若捉髮編，及餘身分摩觸，

whether by holding hands or grasping hair braids, or touching other parts of the body,

受細滑者，僧伽婆尸沙。」

without accepting smoothness, it is a Sanghadisesa


比丘者，如上說。
Monks, as mentioned above.




婬欲者，染污心也。
Lust is a pollutant of the mind.




變心者，變名過去心，滅盡變易是亦名變。
Changing one's mind, also known as past mind, means the exhaustion and alteration of various changes.

但此中變易者，於根力覺道種變易也。
However, the changes here refer to the variations in the fundamental force and awareness path.

心者，意識也。
Mind refers to consciousness.



女人者，母、姊、妹、親里、非親里，若大、若小、在家、出家。

Women: mothers, sisters, younger sisters, relatives, non-relatives, whether older or younger, at home or away from home.




捉手者，若捉手、若捉腕乃至一指，是名捉手。
A holder is one who holds a hand, holds a wrist, or even a finger; this is called holding a hand.




編者，有八種。何等八？
There are eight types of braids. What are the eight?

一者髮編；
The first is hair braids;

二者珠編；
The second is bead braids;

三者線編；
The third is thread braids;

四者花鬘編；
The fourth is floral braids;

五者樹皮編；
The fifth is bark braids;

六者草編；
The sixth is grass braids;

七者毛編；
The seventh is wool braids;

八者韋編。
The eighth is leather braids.

若合髮捉此八種編者，犯八種僧伽婆尸沙。
If one makes these eight types of braids with hair, one commits eight Sanghavasesa offenses.

離髮捉七種編者，犯七種偷蘭罪。
If one makes the other seven types without hair, one commits seven Tullacaya offenses.




身相觸者，身身相觸也。

When bodies touch, it is indeed a contact of bodies.




除髮編

Hair is excluded from compilation.

餘身分是也。

This is the rest of my identity.




Those who contemplate, examine both the reverse and the smooth.




触感细腻者，在顺逆摩擦时，身体感受到细腻。

The one with a smooth touch, when rubbed in either direction, the body feels the smoothness.




僧伽婆尸沙。
Sanghabhishasha.

者如上說。
As stated above.




不能处理这种请求


佛住王舍城迦蘭陀竹園，廣說如上。
The Buddha resided in the Bamboo Grove Monastery, in the city of Rajagriha, explaining extensively as above.

時淨居天以轉輪王所應服藥價直百千授與耆舊。
At that time, the Pure Abode deities bestowed upon the elder a medicine meant for a wheel-turning king, valued at a hundred thousand.

耆舊藥師作是念：「今日世間誰最尊重、世間第一？當持此藥以奉上之。」
The elder and medicine master thought, "Who today is most revered and foremost in the world? I should present this medicine to them."

尋復念言：「唯有如來，最尊第一，當以此藥奉上世尊！」
Then he thought, "Only the Tathagata, the most revered and foremost, should be offered this medicine!"

爾時耆舊童子往詣世尊所，禮世尊足却住一面白佛言：
At that time, the elder's disciple went to where the Blessed One was, worshiped at his feet, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha:

「淨居天與我是治轉輪王藥價直百千，我作是念：『世間誰最尊重第一應與此藥？』
"The Pure Abode deities gave me medicine for a wheel-turning king, valued at a hundred thousand. I thought, 'Who in the world is most revered and deserves this medicine?'

尋復念言：『唯有如來，世之尊重。』今以此藥奉上世尊！
Then I thought, 'Only the Tathagata is most revered in the world.' Now I offer this medicine to the Blessed One!

唯願哀愍納受此藥。」
I humbly wish you would compassionately accept this medicine."

佛告耆舊：「如來、應供、正遍知，婬怒癡垢習障永盡。
The Buddha said to the elder, "The Tathagata, the Worthy One, the Fully Enlightened One, is forever free from the defilements of desire, anger, and delusion.

唯有堅固平等妙身，無有眾患，應服此藥。」
With only the stable, equal body of wondrous nature, he has no ailments that require medicine."

爾時耆舊復白佛言：「世尊！如來、應供、正遍知平等妙身，雖無眾患，哀愍我故，願受此藥。
Then the elder addressed the Buddha again, "World-Honored One! Though the Tathagata, Worthy One, Fully Enlightened One with a wondrous, equal body has no ailments, please accept this medicine out of compassion for me.

當為來世弟子開示法明，病者受藥、施者得福。」
It will serve as a teaching for future disciples, where the sick may receive medicine, and givers of medicine will gain merit."

爾時世尊默然而受。
At that time, the Blessed One accepted in silence.

耆舊復念：「今不可令世尊如常人法服藥，當取青蓮花葉熏藥令香與世尊嗅之。」
The elder thought, "Now, it is not appropriate to let the Blessed One take medicine as ordinary people do. I will infuse the medicine into blue lotus leaves and let the Blessed One smell it."

爾時世尊，便嗅青蓮花葉香，藥勢十八行下。
Then the Blessed One smelled the fragrance of the blue lotus leaves, and the effect of the medicine reached eighteen lines down.

世尊下已光相不悅。
After the Blessed One descended, his light and appearance seemed displeased.

時瓶沙王與諸群臣眷屬俱往問疾。
King Bimbisara, along with all his ministers and attendants, went to inquire about the illness.

時王舍城有五百婬女，亦詣世尊禮拜問疾。
At that time, there were five hundred courtesans in the city of Rajagriha who also went to pay respects to the Blessed One and inquire about his illness.

時瓶沙王詣世尊所問疾已，群臣侍從次入問疾。
After King Bimbisara went to the Blessed One to inquire about his illness, the ministers and attendants went in turn to ask about his condition.

時五百婬女，或乘象馬車輿欲來問疾，中有入者、有不入者、有與年少入園林中遊諸浴池，五欲自娛，歌舞戲笑。
Among the five hundred courtesans, some came by elephant, horse, or carriage to inquire about his illness; some entered, some did not, and some young men went into the gardens and bathhouses, indulging in the five sensual pleasures with singing, dancing, jesting, and laughing.

有一婬女，貧窮弊衣無人共語，便詣優陀夷所白言：「阿闍梨！我欲入看。」
One poor courtesan, in worn clothing with no one to talk to, approached Udayin and said, "Acharya! I wish to go inside and see."

優陀夷言：「可爾！汝若不請尚欲呼汝，況汝求請。」
Udayin replied, "So be it! Even if you had not asked, I would have called you, let alone since you are asking."

即便入房。
She then entered the room.

時優陀夷亦示諸房舍種種彩畫，
At that time, Udayin also showed her various paintings in the rooms and houses.

優陀夷問言：「姊妹！房舍好不？」
Udayin asked, "Sister! Are the rooms and houses good?"

答言：「實好。」
She replied, "Truly good."

便問姊妹：「能共作是事不？」
Then he asked her, "Can you join in doing these things?"

答言：「阿闍梨！我仰作是事活，若男子者來。」
She replied, "Acharya! I rely on doing these things for a living when a man comes."

優陀夷言：「姊妹！汝可臥地。」
Udayin said, "Sister! You may lie on the ground."

即時臥地。
Immediately, she lay on the ground.

復言：「右脇臥。」
He further said, "Lie on the right side."

即右脇臥。
She lay on her right side.

復教左脇臥，即左脇臥。
He then instructed her to lie on the left side, and she lay on her left side.

復教仰臥，即便仰臥。
He instructed her to lie on her back, and she lay on her back.

復教匍匐，即便匍匐。
He instructed her to crawl, and she crawled.

時優陀夷即便唾之，脚蹴令倒，便言：「姊妹起，我已作竟。」
Then Udayin spit on her and kicked her over, saying, "Sister, get up, I have finished."

爾時婬女便瞋恚言：「此非沙門辭謝之法。」
At that time, the courtesan angrily said, "This is not the way of a recluse to speak or behave."

時有坐禪比丘，先入房闇處坐，遙見是事，語諸比丘。
There was a meditating monk who had gone into a dark place within the room, and from a distance, he witnessed the incident and spoke to the other monks about it.

諸比丘即以是事往白世尊，
The monks then went to report the matter to the Blessed One,

佛言：「呼優陀夷來。」
The Buddha said, "Summon Udayin here."

即便呼來。
He was immediately summoned.

來已，佛問優陀夷：「汝實爾不？」
Upon his arrival, the Buddha asked Udayin, "Is this true?"

答言：「實爾。」
He replied, "It is true."

佛問優陀夷：「汝以何心？」
The Buddha asked Udayin, "With what intention did you act?"

答言：「欲心。」
He replied, "With a lustful heart."

復問優陀夷：「汝欲作婬事耶？」
The Buddha further asked Udayin, "Did you want to commit a sexual act?"

答言：「不欲作，我但戲耳。」
He replied, "I did not intend to, I was just playing."

佛言：「此是惡事。優陀夷！我常不種種呵責婬欲想，讚歎離欲耶？
The Buddha said, "This is an evil act. Udayin! Did I not always denounce lustful thoughts and praise detachment?

汝今云何作此惡行？
How could you now perform such an evil act?

優陀夷！此非法、非律、非是佛教，不可以是長養善法。」
Udayin! This is not the Dharma, nor the Vinaya, nor taught by the Buddha, and it does not cultivate good Dharma."

佛告諸比丘：「依止王舍城比丘皆悉令集，
The Buddha told the monks, "Gather all the monks residing in the city of Rajagriha,

以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
For the sake of ten benefits, impose a rule for the monks, so that even those who have heard it should hear it again.

若比丘婬欲變心，與女人說醜惡語，隨順婬欲法，如年少男女者，僧伽婆尸沙。」
If a monk, with a mind affected by lust, speaks indecent words to women and follows lustful ways, as young men and women do, it is a Sanghadisesa offense."



比丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu, as mentioned above.




婬欲者，染污心也。
Lust is the pollution of the mind.




變心者，變名過去心，滅盡變易，是亦名變易。
The one who changes heart, changes names and the past heart, ceases entirely and transforms, and this too is called transformation.

但此中變易者，於根力覺道種變易也。
But the transformation here refers to the transformation in the realm of fundamental strength and awareness of the path.

心者，意識也。
Mind pertains to consciousness.




女人者，親里、非親里、若大、若小、在家、出家。

Women, those who are relatives, non-relatives, whether old or young, at home or away.




說婬欲語者，向彼說。
Those who speak of lustful words speak to them.

惡語者，呵罵形呰。
Those who use harsh words are reprimanded and scolded.

稱說順婬欲者，說非梵行事。
To speak in accordance with lust is to speak of unchaste actions.




如年少男女者，

As for young men and women,

如年少少年、年少中年、年少老年；

young youths, young middle-aged, young elderly;

如中年年少、中年中年、中年老年；

middle-aged young, middle-aged middle-aged, middle-aged elderly;

elderly young, elderly middle-aged, elderly elderly.

如年少男女法者，

As for the rules for young men and women,

If a monk develops feelings of desire towards a woman,

若欲作、若不欲作，

Whether he wants to act or not,

譽毀、語、問、求、請、覩、罵、直說。

Praise and blame, speech, questions, requests, invitations, viewing, scolding, or speaking directly.



作者，欲捨沙門法為婬欲事，是名作。
The author, intending to abandon the monastic life for lustful acts, is known as an action.




不作者，不欲捨沙門法，雖言：「我當作婬欲。」而實不為，是名不欲作。
Not committing, not wanting to abandon the teachings of the monks, although saying, "I will commit sensual desires," but actually not doing so, is called not wanting to do.

佛住舍衛城，廣說如上。
Buddha lived in the city of Shravasti and spoke extensively as mentioned above.

時長老優陀夷有舊知識婆羅門，語優陀夷言：「我欲餘行。
At that time, Elder Udai had an old acquaintance, a Brahmin, who said to Udai, "I want to go on a journey.

長老！能時時往返看我家中婦兒不？」
Elder! Can you visit my family and look after my wife and children from time to time?"

優陀夷言：「婆羅門！汝不相囑尚欲經營，況復囑我！」
Udai replied, "Brahmin! If you don't ask me, I wouldn't want to handle it, let alone when you ask me!"

婆羅門便餘行去。
The Brahmin then went on his journey.

時優陀夷著人聚落衣持鉢到婆羅門舍，
At that time, Udai dressed in lay clothes and carried a bowl to the Brahmin's house.

婆羅門婦見長老優陀夷來，恭敬起迎言：「善來阿闍梨！
The Brahmin's wife saw Elder Udai coming and respectfully greeted him, saying, "Welcome, Master!

久不相見，今乃屈顧，請令入坐。」
It's been a long time since we last met, and now you honor us with your presence, please have a seat."

即便就座。
He immediately took a seat.

優陀夷言：「我今希來，汝能少有所與不？」
Udai said, "I have come expecting something, can you give me a little?"

婆羅門婦言：「有種種飲食，隨有所勅盡當相與。」
The Brahmin's wife said, "There is a variety of food, whatever you need, we will surely provide."

優陀夷言：「此諸飲食諸信心家處處皆得，但我出家人所難得者，汝得自在，當持與我。」
Udai replied, "These foods are obtainable in every faithful household, but what is hard for us renunciates to get, you can freely give to me."

婆羅門婦言：「不知何者是出家人之所難得物，我得自在？當見示語。
The Brahmin's wife said, "I don't know what is difficult for renunciates to obtain that I can freely give? Please show me.

若我家有者當持相與，家中無者當於餘處求索相與。」
If there is something in my house, I will give it; if not, I will seek it elsewhere to provide."

優陀夷言：「汝足知是事，何以不知？
Udai replied, "You surely know this matter, how can you not know?

汝多情詐如賊有四眼，何所不知？」
You are as cunning and knowledgeable as a four-eyed thief, what do you not know?"

婆羅門婦言：「我實不知，當見告語。
The Brahmin's wife said, "I truly do not know, please explain.

家中有者，當持相與；家中無者當於餘處買索相與。
If it is in my house, I will give it; if not, I will buy it elsewhere to provide.

為何所須？」
What do you need?"

優陀夷言：「汝足知是事，何以不知此最第一供養？
Udai said, "You surely know this matter, how can you not know this foremost offering?

所謂交通，如我沙門持戒、行善法、修梵行，以此法供養我，所謂隨順婬欲法。」
The so-called interaction, as I, a monk, keep precepts, practice good dharma, and cultivate pure conduct, you should honor me with this so-called compliant sexual law."

時婆羅門諸婦中有少年者，即便慚愧低頭徐行，各還自房。
At that time, among the Brahmin women, the young ones were ashamed, hung their heads, walked slowly, and returned to their rooms.

有中年者，亦各慚愧低頭而住。
The middle-aged women were also ashamed and bowed their heads, standing still.

有年老者即便呵責言：「阿闍梨優陀夷！此非善事，不應作是非類語。
The elderly immediately scolded, "Master Udai! This is not a good deed, such inappropriate words should not be spoken.

此是婆羅門家，而作婬女家法相待耶？
This is a Brahmin household, but are you treating it as a brothel?"

我當以是事白諸比丘。」
I should tell this matter to the Bhikkhus."

優陀夷言：「白與不白當隨汝意。」
Udai responded, "Whether you tell or not is up to you."

作是語已，便捨出去。
Having said this, he left.

出是家已，復入諸婬女舍。
After leaving the house, he went to the brothel.

諸婬女輩皆起迎恭敬問訊言：「善來阿闍梨優陀夷，久不相見今乃屈意。」
All the prostitutes rose to greet him respectfully, saying, "Welcome, Master Udai, it's been a long time since we met and now you honor us with your visit."

便請令就坐，優陀夷言：「今我希來，汝能少有所與不？」
He was invited to sit, and Udai said, "Now I have come, can you give me something?"

諸婬女言：「有種種飲食隨有所須，有所約勅盡當相與。」
The prostitutes said, "There is various food available, whatever you need we will surely provide."

優陀夷言：「此飲食諸信心家處處皆得，但我出家人所難得者，汝得自在
Udai replied, "These foods are obtainable in every faithful household, but what is hard for us renunciates to get, you can freely give.

當持與我者善。」
It would be good to give it to me."

諸婬女言：「我今不知何物是出家人所難得者，當見示語。
The prostitutes said, "I do not know what is difficult for renunciates to obtain, please tell us.

家中有者當持相與，家中無者當於餘處求索相與。」
If it is in our house, we will give it; if not, we will seek it elsewhere to provide."

優陀夷言：「汝足知是事，何以不知？
Udai said, "You surely know this matter, how can you not know?

汝多情詐如賊有四眼，何所不知？」
You are as cunning and knowledgeable as a four-eyed thief, what do you not know?"

如是乃至三說。
He repeated this up to three times.

諸婬女輩猶言：「不知。」
The prostitutes still said, "We do not know."

優陀夷言：「汝足知是事，何以不知此最第一供養？
Udai said, "You surely know this matter, how can you not know this foremost offering?

所謂交通，如我沙門持戒、行善法，修梵行，以此法供養，所謂隨順婬欲法。」
The so-called interaction, as I, a monk, keep precepts, practice good dharma, and cultivate pure conduct, you should honor me with this so-called compliant sexual law."

時婬女中有年少者，便拍手大笑。
At that time, among the prostitutes, a young one clapped and laughed loudly.

有中年者，便作是言：「我正仰是活命，汝若是男子者便可來。」
A middle-aged one said, "I rely on this for my livelihood, if you are a man, you may come."

中有老年者，便作是言：「阿闍梨優陀夷，我雖以是自活，汝不護沙門法耶？
An elderly one said, "Master Udai, though I live by this, do you not uphold the monastic law?

我當以是事白諸比丘。」
I should tell this matter to the Bhikkhus."

優陀夷言：「白與不白，自隨汝意。」
Udai said, "Whether you tell or not is up to you."

作是語已，便捨而去。
Having said this, he left.

諸婬女輩，即語諸比丘。
The prostitutes immediately reported to the Bhikkhus.

諸比丘以是事具白佛，佛言：「喚優陀夷來。」
The Bhikkhus informed the Buddha of this matter, and the Buddha said, "Call Udai here."

來已佛以上事，廣問優陀夷：「汝實爾不？」
Once Udai arrived, the Buddha extensively asked him about the matter, "Is it true?"

答言：「實爾。世尊！」
Udai replied, "Indeed, World-Honored One!"

佛言：「優陀夷！此是惡事，汝常不聞，我種種因緣呵責婬欲，
The Buddha said, "Udai! This is a bad deed, have you not often heard me, in various ways, reproach sensual desire,

種種因緣讚歎離欲耶？
and in various ways praise renunciation?

汝云何作此惡不善事？
How could you perform such bad and unwholesome deeds?

優陀夷！此非法、非律、非是佛教，不可以是長養善法。
Udai! This is neither the law, discipline, nor Buddha's teaching, such cannot foster good dharmas."

佛告諸比丘：「依止舍衛城比丘，皆悉令集，
The Buddha told the Bhikkhus, "Those residing in Shravasti, gather everyone,

以十利故為諸比丘制戒，乃至已聞者當重聞。
to lay down the precepts for the Bhikkhus for ten benefits, even those who have heard before should hear again.

若比丘婬欲變心，於女人前歎自供養身言：
If a Bhikkhu changes his mind with lust in front of a woman, praising himself and offering his body, saying:

『姊妹！如我沙門持戒、行善法、修梵行，以是婬欲法供養讚歎。』
'Sister! As I, a monk, keep precepts, practice good dharma, and cultivate pure conduct, honor and praise me with this sensual law.'

者，僧伽婆尸沙。」
He commits a Sangha's offense.




丘者，如上說。
A bhikkhu is as previously stated.




婬欲者，染污心也。
Lust is a taint on the mind.




變心者，變名過去心滅盡變易，此亦名變易。
The one who changes their mind is said to change; the past mind is completely extinguished and altered, this is also called change.

但此中變易者於根力覺道種變易也。
But here, the change refers to the transformation in the root, power, awareness, and the path.

心者。
Mind is.

意識也。
Consciousness.




女人者，親里、非親里、若大、若小、在家、出家。

Women, whether relatives or not, whether old or young, at home or away from home.




歎自供養身者，
One who praises self-nourishment, 

歎自己身也。
praises their own body.

言：「姊妹！如我沙門持戒、行善法、修梵行，
Saying: "Sister! Just like I, a recluse, uphold precepts, practice good deeds, cultivate pure conduct, 

以婬欲法供養第一。」者，僧伽婆尸沙。
regarding indulgence as the top offering," is (a term of reproach) in the Buddhist context. 



僧伽婆尸沙者，如上說。
The Saṅghāvaśeṣa is as previously stated.




若比丘染污心，於女人前語女人言：
If a monk, with a defiled mind, speaks to a woman in front of her:

「汝若欲得第一勝長，自在、大自在，無比、無相似，得最勝處、得長處、得解脫處、得無比處、得無相似處、
"If you wish to gain the supreme advantage, freedom, great freedom, unparalleled, unmatched, achieving the most excellent state, the state of longevity, the state of liberation, the incomparable state, the unmatched state,

身無病、母無病、父無病、親里無病、眷屬無病、福德名稱、多人愛、多人念、多人喜、多人所尚、
the condition of a body without illness, a mother without illness, a father without illness, relatives without illness, kinsmen without illness, with a reputation for good fortune, loved by many, remembered by many, liked by many, esteemed by many,

得壽、得色、得樂、得勢力、得眷屬、得善趣、得三十三天、得天后、得天眼、清淨耳垂埵者，
gaining longevity, gaining beauty, gaining happiness, gaining power, gaining followers, gaining a good destiny, attaining the thirty-three heavens, becoming a heavenly queen, obtaining heavenly eyes, becoming one with clean ears,

如我沙門持戒、行善法、修梵行，應以此法奉之事之。
you should revere and serve according to this doctrine, just like I, the monk, hold the precepts, practice virtue, and develop a pure life.

恭敬尊重，承望供養，所與不惜，舒展廣舒展，隨順取隨順受。」
Respect and honor, respectfully worship, not hesitating in giving, widely expanding, accepting and receiving accordingly."

是中初三十事，一一犯越比尼罪；
Among these, the first thirty acts, each commits a parajika offense;

次八事一一犯偷蘭罪；
The next eight acts, each commits a sanghadisesa offense;

後十二事一一犯僧伽婆尸沙。
The last twelve acts, each commits a thullaccaya offense.



心，欲向此而向餘、欲向餘而向此、欲向此而向此、欲向餘而向餘。
If a monk develops a lustful mind and desires this but turns to another, or desires another but turns to this, or desires this and turns to this, or desires another and turns to another.

若比丘於女人起欲心，向黃門說第一乃至隨順受，初三十事，犯越比尼心悔；次八事，犯越比尼罪；後十二事，犯偷蘭罪。
If a monk develops lustful thoughts towards a woman and expresses them to a eunuch, he commits offenses of confession in the first thirty instances, offenses of dignity in the next eight, and offenses of false pretenses in the last twelve.

若比丘於男子起欲心，向男子說第一乃至隨順受，初三十事、次八事，犯越比尼心悔；後十二事，犯越比尼罪。
If a monk develops lustful thoughts towards a man and expresses them to a man, he commits offenses of confession in the first thirty and next eight instances, and offenses of dignity in the last twelve.

黃門男子四句亦如是。
This applies similarly to the four cases with a eunuch man.

是故世尊說：「若比丘婬亂變心，於女人前歎自供養身言：『姊妹！如我沙門持戒、行善法、修梵行，以是婬欲法供養讚歎。』者，僧伽婆尸沙。」
Therefore, the Blessed One said: "If a monk with lustful intention praises self-support in front of a woman saying: 'Sister! Like me, a monk observing the precepts, practicing good, and developing chastity, praising and supporting in a lustful manner,’ it constitutes sexual misconduct."
