A Buddha named "Shakyamuni" (meaning "Sage of the Shakya Clan") appears ~500BC (dates are tricky this far back). This name comes from this living Buddha being born Siddhartha Gautama, prince of the Shakya clan.

Being this Buddha he teaches in many regions of India with large procession of followers. After this living Buddha's death, his followers continue his teachings and traditions until the present day.

When these followers first assembled following this death the monk Ananda, also born into the Shakya clan (Siddhartha's cousin) was able to recite the teachings from memory. Of a noble birth, trained in memorization, recitation, and the structure of mnemonics, Ananda had been transmitting the teaching this way for some time.

Sariputra was another of the Buddha's followers, known for his wisdom and insight. Even in the Buddha's lifetime, Sariputra was began to assemble the Buddha's teachings into a structured form.

The Buddha had many notable senior disciples, but Ananda and Sariputra become the most notable after his death because they are the more directly involved in the forms of transmission and preservation that persist in more or the less the same form to the present day.

By the second time the Buddha's followers meet after his death, they begin to assemble the teachings into collections. It is also at this time that the first sectarian divisions begin to appear. Over the coming centuries, these divisions will continue and each division will maintain its own collection of teachings.

These teachings are maintained by both an oral and, eventually, a written tradition. While preservation is a primary concern, the teachings are also subject to interpretation,elaboration, and the influence of cultures in which they are transmitted.

Ananda's teachings ("Thus have I heard,") are first collected in written form as "Connected" (sanskrit:saṃyukta, pali:saṃyutta) discourses, and Sariputra's systems form the basis of Abdhidharma.

With each division maintaining its own collection of teachings there is not single canonical source for the Buddha's teachings. Many teachings were expanded over time and there are many versions of the same teaching in different collections. These expansions happen over time but it appears to be the case that the Saṃyukta collection was the first.

There are two lineages from which we have well preserved Saṃyukta texts. They evolved from earlier splits in Buddhism. Rather than explain each division in detail we can observe that each division shares the same characteristics: there is a "conservative" division that preserves earlier forms and one more willing to adapt to new forms.

From the first division we do not have a complete collection of Saṃyukta texts. So we only have well preserved collections from the division most concerned with preserving form, which makes sense given the fact that this was before texts were being written and oral transmissions were the only preservation method.

There is a later divide in Buddhism that can be characterized similarly to the early division. From this we have two well preserved collections: the Saṃyukta Agama and the Saṃyukta Nikaya.

The Nikaya's are born from the more conservative tradition. In fact, the Theravada tradition that has been preserving this collection still exists.

The Agama's were more open to change and adaptation. As Mahayana Buddhism developed, the Agama's were the texts that were most often used by Buddhists in the Mahayana tradition and is well preserved in the Chinese Canon.

Paper was invented in China. Chinese Buddhists were incredible preservationists and as textual reproductions became more common alteration to texts became less common. We have many Agamas from very early periods in Chinese history while the Nikayas we have are from much later periods. Although both collections are well preserved, there are many differences between them that would appear to be related to the cultures that preserved them.

The Agamas are noted for the improved role of women and nuns when compared to the Nikayas. Agama texts were also translated into Chinese during a period of Mahayana Buddhism and are the way many Buddhists understood the early teachings.
